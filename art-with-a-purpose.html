<h2>Art with a purpose is propaganda</h2>

<p>
It might be <em>correct</em> propaganda, for your definition of correct, but it
is propaganda nonetheless.
</p>

<p>
Art usually gets repurposed as propaganda over a long enough time frame, but
that's not what I'm talking about.
</p>

<p>
This is not a pejoritive: propaganda is useful, just like entertainment, and
artists are often involved in all three. But not all art is created by artists.
</p>

<p>
Maybe I should not call it art - these artifact of an unspeakable, unsupressible
urge to create. These are without purpose. They just are.
