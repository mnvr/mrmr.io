<p>
Once I was having a dream. I don't remember the dream, but it wasn't a pleasant
one (not a nightmare, just not a pleasant one).
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, I realized that I don't have to have this dream if I don't want to. I
didn't realize that I was in a dream, or that I could control it, or could have
a different one – no, none of that. I just had this thought arise from somewhere
that I don't have to have this dream if I don't want to.
</p>

<p>
Not knowing what else to do, I started focusing on my breath. And, really, I
stopped having that dream. After a while, I dissolved into a dreamless sleep.
</p>

<p>I woke up. And wondered if that trick works when I’m awake.</p>
