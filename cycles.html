Cycles

We are in the midst of cycles, varying in frequencies.

Each day our body cycles through the circadian rhythm. A day being the time it took Earth to complete one revolution. Our bodies evolved to this beat, this rhythm.

By the time the Moon revolves around the Earth twelve times, the Earth has revolved around the Sun once. We call this a year.

Many social cycles are based around a year, and it also illustrates that not only does the frequency but the phase matters; seasons are but phase shifts.

A cycle within a cycle is just two cycles whose phases happen to coincide at zero crossings. They're common within music. A guitarist soloes around the fretboard to reach the bass note at the same time as the bass player, the arrival at both coinciding with the drummer's kick drum.

You might think two cycles are not enough, but they are. The Chinese label each year using two interlocked cycles - a cycle of 12 animals, and a cycle of 5 elements. Both run independently, but the two are enough to label uniquely label each year in roughly a human lifetime, 60 years. Most people will live to see most combination only once, and not more than twice, making each year in their life have a memorable name, and a tint of its own.

By the way, this year's is the year of the Wooden Rat: A year to shed old patterns, embrace new possibilities, and foster resilience in the face of challenges.

A human lifetime is but one in the cycle of birth, death and rebirth that we experience according to the Hindu tradition. Not just people though; the universe itself cycles through Kalpas. Each kalpa is the universe getting created, hanging around for a while, and then being destroyed, similar to the theories of cyclic exapansion and contraction that some astronomers believe our universe follows.

This similarity is not a coincidence, because there eventually are only three options. Either things have a start and an end; or only a start; or are timeless - and in the latter two cases, cycles are to be expected. And it seems a bit ad-hoc if the first case was as isolated occurence, happening only once.

---

Whether or not the universe cycles through kalpas, even within the realm of a single kalpa, cycles still abound. They're what make each day, each year, each lifetime unique. With just a few cycles we experience each moment as a unique creation, and with so many cycles going on in the same time, it's no wonder Heraclitus was not able to step in the same river twice, or why the Japanese have a word ichigo ichie to refer to the uniqueness of each cup of tea: the host is different, the guest is different, the place is different, the water is different, sometimes so is the tea, the season is different, and the sun is in a different place in the sky.

If God is running a procedural map generator, he certainly doesn't need too many cycles to interplay for making each run of the game a different one.
