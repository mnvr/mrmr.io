<h2>Evoke</h2>

<p>
Here is a style of rhetoric I’ve been thinking about. No convincing, no agenda,
no audience in mind. State the premises, sketch out the interconnections, don’t
draw out the conclusions. Such a style feels aphoristic, vague and pretentious
even. That’s a bit sad, I wish it didn’t come off that way.
</p>

<p>
Art doesn’t limit imagination, but sometimes warrants too much from it. Words
provide better precision, but sometimes limit the imagination too much.
Examples, analogies and conclusions make it harder for the reader to see further
than (at best) the author's mind. The aim is not to convey meaning (whatever
that means). The aim is to trigger analogous processes in the reader’s mind.
