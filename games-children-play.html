<h3>Games children play</h3>

<p>
I was walking on a remote road in the mountains once. Not too remote, since
there was a road, but it was in a bad shape, so remote enough.
</p>

<p>
Housed along the road, in temporary ramshackle shacks, were housed migrant
workers who were rebuilding the road. In a clearing nearby, their children
played.
</p>

<p>
Who had taught them the games they were playing?
</p>

<p>
Children's games are not written down in any book, or at least not in books
children read. Nobody tells children of the games that they should play, except
other children, but childhood is an institution of great churn, with individuals
joining and leaving in abrupt ways.
</p>

<p>
In this temporary remote conglomeration the lack of apparent (formal or
informal) mechanisms of knowledge preservation is even more stark since the
migration families had no prior connections. Some of them were from Bihar, some
from Nepal. I mention specifics to emphasize that there were no strong
geographical, or cultural, threads that connected these children.
</p>

<p>
Yet this institutional knowledge remained, and they knew what games to play.
