# Required
#
title: Example page
#

# -------- Rest everything is optional --------

# The date the page was created.
#
# This is the field that is used to sort pages. By default, pages are
# sorted in descending order of this date field whenever they're being collected
# for listing.
#
# This field is also used by some pages to show by a date in their footers.
#
# The date format is `YYYY-MM-DD`.
#
# If there are multiple pages with the same date, then they'll be sorted by their
# titles. However, if we wish to force them to use some particular order, we
# can alternatively use a longer date format that includes the times to
# disambiguate between them and use the order we wish (the fallback sort by
# title only happens if the date field is an exact match).
#
# This field is sort-of non-optional for normal pages, but it can be omitted
# for unlisted pages (because unlisted pages don't usually need to get sorted
# for listings).
date: 2023-03-15
#

# A description for the page
#
# This will be shown, for example, as the subtitle if someone shares a link to
# this page on their social media.
#
# If this is not provided, then an autogenerated one will be used.
#description:
#

# A string to show instead of the formatted date when rendering the signoff
# section of a page.
#
# If this is not provided, then we will generate one from the `date`. As such,
# this is meant for pages that wish to override the formatted date.
#
# Datatype is string.
#formatted-signoff-date:
#

# The colors to use for the page.
#
# - If not specified, then a readable (dark/light mode aware) set of
#   defaults will be used.
# - If specified, then we need at least 2 values. The first one is the
#   background, and the second one is the foreground.
# - We can specify more too, up to 4, they'll be used for specific scenarios
#   (e.g hover states).
# - The color values can be specified in all ways they can be specified in CSS.
colors:
    - aliceblue
    - cornflowerblue
# Optional variation of colors to use in dark mode.
#
# - If specified, these will replace `colors` when the user's browser is set to
#   prefer dark mode.
dark-colors:
    - purple
    - white

# Specify the color palette to use.
#
# This is an alternative way to specify colors by mentioning a named palette
# set instead of listing the colors out one by one.
#
# See PageColorStyle.tsx for available color themes. Currently, the following
# exist:
# - text
#
# If not specified, and the colors are also not specified, then a default
# color palette is used.
#theme: default

# Set this to true to prevent this page from showing up in the site wide
# listings, e.g. `/all`.
#
# By default, this is `false`.
#
# We set it to `true` here since this is an example page.
unlisted: true
#

# Add the "noindex" meta tag to the generated HTML for the page to prevent it
# from being indexed by search engines. This can be useful, e.g., when we have
# non-deterministic or dynamically generated content, say like the `/quotes`
# page.
#
# By default, this is `false`.
#noindex: true
#

# Specify a layout to use.
#
# By default, the minimal CSS resets are made (primarily, setting the body
# margin to 0), and the colors are setup. Then the MDX is rendered as is.
#
# The intent is that customization should be done inside out, by abstracting
# away the customizations in `components/` and including them in the MDX.
#
# Still, should one need to, there is also the option of a more conventional
# outside-in customization using a layout.
#
# See `layouts/` for supported layouts. Currently, the following exist:
# - basic
# - text
layout: basic
#

# Specify one or more attributes of the page.
#
# These tags are arbitrary labels for posts, but some of these labels are
# treated specially and have a functional impact.
#
# Known tags with special meanings:
#
# - "front-page"
#   This page will be shown in the home (front page) listing.
#
# - "poem"
#   This page will be shown in the /poems listing
#
# Data type is list of strings. Default is empty.
#tags: []
#

# Specify the slugs of related pages.
#
# Some layouts show this list to show links to these related pages in the
# footer of the page.
#
# Data type is list of strings. Default is empty.
#related: []
