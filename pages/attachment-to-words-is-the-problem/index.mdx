It is not words that are a problem, it is the attachment to them. Fine, you say,
I’ll just use words without getting attached to them.

There are two problems we face if we try to do that though. Firstly, it is very
hard in practice. Secondly, it goes against the evolutionary tribalism that’s
built into us.

Holding two opposing thoughts in our head, giving them varying amounts of
credence without discarding either outright, acting on the one to which we
attach higher belief without being angered by the presence of the other. This
sounds very exhausting if done consciously, and it is.

But some people do it quite well. So it can be done. All of us do it to some
extent, that’s how we learn.

It involves accepting hypocrisy, without falling into cynically using it to
justify dishonesty. This I feel is not hard mentally, but what is very hard is
dealing with the external repercussions of previous words.
