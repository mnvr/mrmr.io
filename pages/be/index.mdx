How is it, that from the void follows action?<br/>
All I can do is do / All I can be is be

Sometimes I forget / The shape of happiness<br/>
All we can do is do / All one can be is be

Brightly lit runways / Airports on foggy nights<br/>
All we can do is do / All we can be is be

Under the watchful eyes of the moon<br/>
The stars watch me sleep<br/>
All they can do is burn<br/>
All I can do is be<br/>

In whose light that I see<br/>
Stars / Eternity<br/>

Do<br/>
Be<br/>
