I like science, but dislike the religious zeal of its adherents. Their childish
naïvety equating what cannot be measured (yet!) to what does not exist. That
what cannot be spoken of, does not exist.

Science has happened, under various names, for ages, without the scientific
method. Nor is the current approach infallible: under the coat of rationality
lurk “fashion, faith and fantasy” (in the words of Roger Penrose), similar to
other human endeavors.

The scientific method is indeed the miles ahead of the random flailing about
that we did at times in the past, but it is not the end all and be all.
Insisting on it smothers the underlying curiosity that really drives science.
