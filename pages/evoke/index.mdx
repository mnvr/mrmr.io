<C.Text>

Here is a style of rhetoric I’ve been thinking about. No convincing, and no agenda.

Just state the premises, sketch out the interconnections if needed but, don’t
draw out the conclusions.

This style feels aphoristic, vague and pretentious even. That’s a bit sad, I
wish it didn’t come off that way.

But it is necessary so as to not limit the imagination of the reader.

Art doesn’t limit imagination, but sometimes warrants too much from it. Words
provide better precision, but sometimes limit the imagination too much. Spoon
fed examples, analogies and conclusions make it harder for the reader to see
further than (at best) the author's mind.

Instead of conveying meaning the aim is to trigger analogous processes in the
reader’s mind.
