We are defined by our relationships. Not just we, everything. Words, concepts,
and even quantum states - nothing has any inherent selfness of its own but is
instead a product of the relationships that it is a part of.

The prompt for today, the first day of Genuary, the first day of January, and
the first day of 2024!, was _Particles_. This sketch is a remix of <C.ELink
href="https://x.com/MarnixKeller/status/1741582088833269938">this particle
system by @MarnixKeller</C.ELink>. The essence I've tried to capture is that of
**connected-ness**.
