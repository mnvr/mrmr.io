 * Sketch description

 *
 * The grid is a staggered one, and each cell can be thought of as a rotated
 * square, in half of which a triangle is drawn. Each cell has 2 primary
 * properties - the direction it facing in direction (up, down), and in what
 * color (black or cream) is it filled.
 *
 * The properties of the cells are randomly picked but with a fixed seed. We
 * also increase the chances of a cell facing the same direction as one of the
 * cells above it.
