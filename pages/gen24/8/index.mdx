import * as C from "../components";
import { sketch } from "./sketch";

<C.Layout day={8} sketch={sketch}>

Prompt for today was "Chaotic system".

There is no randomness involved in this sketch, it is being drawn by repeatedly
running the same equation:

```
x = 3.93 * x * (1 - x)
````

Each time feeding it the result from last time around.
