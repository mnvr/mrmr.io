<C.Demo n={1} sketch={s01}>

A minimal straight grid.

At its essence, the code for drawing that grid is just a glorified wrapper
around two nested loops.

```typescript
for (let y = 0; y < 13; y += 1)
    for (let x = 0; x < 13; x += 1)
        p5.rect(x * 50, y * 50, 50, 50)
```

</C.Demo>

<C.Demo n={2} sketch={s02}>

A minimal staggered grid.

We can add a half a cell offset to every alternate row. This gives us a
staggered, less monotonous, appearance. Bricklayers found out that intertwining
this way leads to buildings that are stronger.

</C.Demo>

<C.Demo n={3} sketch={s03}>

Negative space.

Here we rotate the rectangles by 45Â°, and make them smaller. This simple, common
motif keeps brains entertained - because of negative space. It is no longer one
thing, but two images intertwined in the same visual.

</C.Demo>

<C.Demo n={4} sketch={s04}>

Marble floors.

We can do the same thing, but not stagger.

</C.Demo>

<C.Demo n={5} sketch={s05}>

Rotate at the full size.

What if we didn't reduce the size of the square before rotating it though? Of
course, they would start overlapping, but there would still be negative space in
the places where there is no overlap.

</C.Demo>

<C.Demo n={6} sketch={s06}>

If we reintroduce the staggering though, they'll fit back in nicely, just like
how they were in DEX 02 above.

Here we're animating their rotation to show how they fit back in, but this also
shows the variety of effects that can already be produced. We can explore a lot,
these variations, but let us get back to DEX 03 - the one with the staggered,
smaller, and rotated, squares, and cover the negative space by drawing 2 more
rectangles in each cell.

</C.Demo>
