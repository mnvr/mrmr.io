<C.Layout>

<C.Demo n={1}  sketch={straightMin}>
A minimal straight grid.

At its essence, the code for drawing that grid is just a glorified wrapper
around two nested loops.

```typescript
for (let y = 0; y < 13; y += 1)
    for (let x = 0; x < 13; x += 1)
        p5.rect(x * 50, y * 50, 50, 50)
```

</C.Demo>

<C.Demo n={2}  sketch={staggeredMin}>
A minimal staggered grid.

We can add a half a cell offset to every alternate row. This gives us a
staggered, less monotonous, appearance.

</C.Demo>

<C.Demo n={3} sketch={negMin}>
Negative space.

Here we rotate the rectangles by 45Â°, and make them smaller. This simple, common
motif keeps brains entertained - because of negative space. It is no longer one
thing, but two images intertwined in the same visual.
