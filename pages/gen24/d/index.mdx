<C.Demo n={1} sketch={s01}>

A minimal straight grid.

At its essence, the code for drawing that grid is just a glorified wrapper
around two nested loops.

```typescript
for (let y = 0; y < 13; y += 1)
    for (let x = 0; x < 13; x += 1)
        p5.rect(x * 50, y * 50, 50, 50)
```

</C.Demo>

<C.Demo n={2} sketch={s02}>

A minimal staggered grid.

We can add a half a cell offset to every alternate row. This gives us a
staggered, less monotonous, appearance. Bricklayers found out that intertwining
this way leads to buildings that are stronger.

</C.Demo>

<C.Demo n={3} sketch={s03}>

Negative space.

Here we rotate the rectangles by 45°, and make them smaller. This common motif
keeps brains entertained because of the negative space. It is no longer one
thing, but two images intertwined in the same visual.

</C.Demo>

<C.Demo n={4} sketch={s04}>

Marble floors.

We can do the same thing, but not stagger.

</C.Demo>

<C.Demo n={5} sketch={s05}>

Rotate at the full size.

If we don't reduce the size of the squares before rotating them, they will start
overlapping, but there would still be negative space in the places where there
is no overlap.

</C.Demo>

<C.Demo n={6} sketch={s06}>

If we reintroduce the staggering though, they'll fit back in nicely, just like
how they were in DEX 02 above.

Here we're animating their rotation to show how they fit back in, but this also
shows the variety of effects that can already be produced.

We could keep exploring these variations, but let us get back to DEX 03 - the
one with the staggered, smaller, and rotated, squares. DEX 03 is a common motif
in Indian, African and many other artworks (this is the Holiday season, so you'd
have probably recently seen it in Christmas sweaters too!).

Part of the popularity probably has to do with how easy it is to make, but I
feel it also has to do with the "necker cube" like phenomena it exhibits - how
it changes shape if we stare at it for a while.

But the next modification blew my mind when I first chanced upon it. By adding a
single rectangle to each cell, we can convert this simple motif into an
isometric grid!

</C.Demo>

<C.Demo n={7} sketch={s07}>

Isometric grid.

I just added one extra rectangle (a quadrilateral, but we can just think of it
as a skewed rectangle) to each cell. In fact, this is the full code for the
function that draws each cell:

```typescript
h = s/2
quad(x, y, x+h, y-h, x+s, y, x+h, y+h)
quad(x, y, x+h, y+h, x+h, y+s, x, y+h)
```

Now, I don't know if this is the best way to draw an isometric grid, or if this
is indeed even an isometric grid technically. I'm an artist by aspiration, not
by ability or training, so I'm just amateuring around. But the simplicity of
this formulation did blow my mind.

I guess this is perhaps because I personally have been enamoured by the
isometric grid (I _think_ that's what this is called!), other people might
indeed find this cliche and common place. I had a carpet once, €20 only, that
had an extremely simple grayscale isometric pattern, and I would stare at it for
more time than I'll acknowledge here, trying to figure out which direction the
cubes actually were facing.

Making these on the computer, I've come across one more aspect of ambiguity - if
I stare at it, sometimes I start seeing these not as cubes, but as diagonal
lines of "kites". Perhaps you can see what I'm talking about - focus on the
negative space, and see how they form lines of "four sided triangles" flowing
towards the top right of the figure.
