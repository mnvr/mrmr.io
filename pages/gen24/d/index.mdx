import * as C from "./components";

import { sketch as isoMin } from "./iso-min";

<C.Layout>

<C.Demo n={1}  sketch={straightMin}>
A minimal straight grid.

At its essence, the code for drawing that grid is just a glorified wrapper
around two nested loops.

```typescript
for (let y = 0; y < 13; y += 1)
    for (let x = 0; x < 13; x += 1)
        p5.rect(x * 100, y * 100, 100, 100)
```

</C.Demo>

<C.Demo n={2}  sketch={staggeredMin}>
A minimal staggered grid
</C.Demo>

<C.Demo n={3} sketch={isoMin}>
A minimal isometric grid
</C.Demo>

</C.Layout>
