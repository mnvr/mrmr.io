                Genuary is an month-long online art fair (that's one way of
                putting it!) that happens every year, in, you guessed it,
                January. This year I thought I'll do remixes of other
                Genuary art that I like.

                Additionally, I've constrained myself to use only grids. So this
                is like a Griduary too.

                I've also created a <Link to="cover">demonstration</Link> to
                show how much can be done just by simple, basic grids - I start
                with the simplest possible grid, and derive the cover art that
                you see at top.
