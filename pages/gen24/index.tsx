                Genuary is an month-long online art fair (that's one way of
                putting it!) that happens every year, in, you guessed it,
                January. This year I thought I'll do remixes of the other
                Genuary art that I come across and find particularly inspiring.
            </p>

                Additionally, I've constrained myself to use only grids. So this
                is like a Griduary too.

                I'm using p5.js to make these sketches, and the{" "}
