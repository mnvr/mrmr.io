Haskell provides a State monad, but it seems a bit too magical at times. There
are many good introductions out there that try to derive the State monad from
first principles, but they tend to focus on the "monad" part of it. Here I
approach things from a different direction: as a solution to a practical
problem.

i.e. this is the tutorial I wish I'd seen when I wanted to quickly learn how to
use state monads.

### The problem

We want to compute Fibonacci numbers. Before you start groaning, consider that
this is a great example. We already know what the function should do, so we can
focus on how to non-invasively memoizing functions that recursively call
themselves. The approach we figure out will work for many recursive functions.

Let's start with a plain version

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = print $ fib 7

fib :: Int -> Int
fib 0 = 0
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)
```

If you want to follow along hands on, copy paste this into a file, say fib.hs,
and run it:

```sh
$ runghc fib.hs
13
```

From now I'll only mention the parts of the file that change, so you can keep
modifying the same file and re-running the `runghc fib.hs` command to see
everything play out in action.

Let us memoize this. We want to create a table where we'll store the results of
computing `fib` for a particular number, so that when we're asked to compute the
same `fib` again, we don't do all that work again.

A more realistic way of doing this would use an array or a map to store the
previous results, but I didn't want to distract from the essence of what we're
discussing here, so let us just use a normal list. Each entry in the list will
be a pair `(n, fib n)`.

Such lists are quite common indeed, they turn out to be useful in all sorts of
places, so much so that there is a name for them - they are called _associative
lists_ – and Haskell provides a function to quickly lookup a value in an
associative list. That function is already part of prelude, and guess what, it's
called `lookup`. Here is an example of it in action (this is a `ghci` prompt):

```haskell
> lookup 7 [(1, "One"), (7, "Seven")]
Just "Seven"
```

Using this, we can create our memoized Fibonacci function:

```haskell
fib :: Int -> Int
fib 0 = 0
fib 1 = 1
fib n = let (r, _) = fibmemo n [] in r

type Cache = [(Int, Int)]

fibmemo :: Int -> Cache -> (Int, Cache)
fibmemo n s = case lookup n s of
    Just v -> (v, s)
    Nothing -> let r = fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)
               in (r, (n, r) : s)
```

If you compile and run this, it'll still produce the correct result, but this
version is completely buggy - there is no memoization happening!

Let's take a step back at this point. In almost all other languages, adding
memoization is easy, we just plonk a global state somewhere, and we keep
updating it as our function is called. This doesn't fly in Haskell, for very
good reasons, but still it makes one wistful.

Already the memoized version in Haskell is starting to look messy, and it
doesn't even work yet! But don't despair, we'll complicate this before we're
able to make it simple again. Before enlightenment, carry wood chop water, after
enlightenment, carry wood chop water.

So we'll just (for now) get rid of our concept of a separate "pure" fibonacci
and a "memoized" layer on top - our implementation will have to mix these two
concerns together. Here is a version that works:

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = print $ runFib 7

runFib :: Int -> (Int, Cache)
runFib n = fib n []

type Cache = [(Int, Int)]

fib :: Int -> Cache -> (Int, Cache)
fib 0 s = (0, s)
fib 1 s = (1, s)
fib n s = case lookup n s of
    Just v -> (v, s)
    Nothing -> let (r1, s1) = fib (n - 1) s
                   (r2, s2) = fib (n - 2) s1
                   r = r1 + r2
               in (r, (n, r) : s)
```

Notice that we also return the Cache (which is our memo / lookup table) from the
`runFib` function. We'll eventually stop doing that and only return the result,
but it is instructive to do that for now so that we can see both the result and
the memoized values printed as we go about developing our solution.

```sh
$ runghc fib.hs
(13,[(7,13)])
```

Oh no! Our memo table is empty - it should have all the intermediate values, but
it only has the last value – `(7,13)`. Is our memoization still not working?

Turns out there is a small typo in the last line. `(r, (n, r) : s)` should be
`(r, (n, r) : s2)`. Here is the fixed version of `fib`:

```haskell
fib :: Int -> Cache -> (Int, Cache)
fib 0 s = (0, s)
fib 1 s = (1, s)
fib n s = case lookup n s of
    Just v -> (v, s)
    Nothing -> let (r1, s1) = fib (n - 1) s
                   (r2, s2) = fib (n - 2) s1
                   r = r1 + r2
               in (r, (n, r) : s2)
```

And if we run this again, we'll see that all intermediate entries are also
present in our memoized table:

```sh
$ runghc fib.hs
(13,[(7,13),(6,8),(5,5),(4,3),(3,2),(2,1)])
```

This typo demonstrates how finicky and error prone it is to manually pass this
state around. It gets worse with recursive functions, because we might not
thread the state along one of the code paths accidentally, and everything will
still work, just be dog slow.

Back to work. So what we've done here that instead of letting `fib` be a
function that takes an `Int` and returns an `Int`, we have made it into a
function that takes an `Int` and a `Cache`, and returns an both the result `Int`
and (possibly) modified `Cache` so that we can pass that along. Written as
types, we have:

```haskell
fib :: Int -> Cache -> (Int, Cache)
```

But the beauty of Haskell is that this same function signature can be
interpreted in another way – `fib` is a function that takes an `Int`, and it
returns a new function `Cache -> (Int, Cache)`.

One thing that you might think here is that - shouldn't the arguments be the
other way around? As in, how about if we'd written `fib` this way:

```haskell
fib :: Cache -> Int -> (Int, Cache)
```

We can even argue that this would make more logical sense. However, notice what
happens if we want to memoize some two argument function, say `plus`, in the
future. If we'd done it in that hypothetically flipped way, it's type would look
like:

```haskell
plus :: Cache -> Int -> Int -> (Int, Cache)
```

In the way we're following, it's type would be

```haskell
plus :: Int -> Int -> Cache -> (Int, Cache)
```

Notice how the trailing part of the type is the same! As in, keeping the state
last means that we always return a `Cache -> (Int, Cache)`, no matter how many
arguments the original function that we're memoizing takes.

You might say that what if we want to memoize a function that returns something
other than a `Int`, or whose memo table has a different type like a `Map`? Easy
peasy, we can actually just parameterize these two types:

-   Let us call the type of the state as `s`.

-   Let us call the result type as `a`.

So we end up with this pattern - any function that we want to memoize will take
as many arguments, and of varying types, as it needs. The only requirement we
place is that it should return a function of type `s -> (a, s)`.

Such functions `s -> (a, s)` are called the **State monad**. But we're getting
ahead of ourselves with the "monad" part, forget that I said the m-word.

Let us just talk about values of type `s -> (a, s)`. Trust me with this, and
you'll see soon, that if we follow this convention – that any function that we
want to memoize should return another function `s -> (a, s)` – then it will
become easy to compose them.

So that everyone doesn't go around defining their own typedefs and helper
functions around this, the Haskell standard installation ships with this
predefined. It is called a `State` and is defined in the `Control.Monad.State`
module.

>

So let us modify our code to use the standard library types:

```haskell
import Control.Monad.State

main :: IO ()
main = print $ runFib 7

runFib :: Int -> (Int, Cache)
runFib n = (fib n) []

type Cache = [(Int, Int)]

fib :: Int -> State Cache Int
fib 0 = \s -> (0, s)
fib 1 = \s -> (1, s)
fib n = \s ->
    case lookup n s of
      Just v -> (v, s)
      Nothing -> let (r1, s1) = (fib (n - 1)) s
                     (r2, s2) = (fib (n - 2)) s1
                     r = r1 + r2
                 in (r, (n, r) : s2)
```

Remember, `State s a` (essentially) means `s -> (a, s)`. So we've changed the
type of `fib` from `Int -> Cache -> (Int, Cache)` to `Int -> State Cache Int`.
And it's implementation is changed from, say, `fib 0 s = (0, s)` to
`fib 0 = \s -> (0, s)` to highlight that it is actually returning a function.

This doesn't actually compile though. When I said that `State s a` essentially
means `s -> (a, s)`, I didn't lie, but there is a stress on _essentially_.
Because the actual type of `State` is a bit more complicated (for reasons that
have nothing to do with what we're discussing here). To get this to compile, we
have to make a few changes:

1. Wrap the returned functions in a `StateT`.
2. Wrap the returned values from these functions in an `Identity` (this'll also
   require adding an `import Control.Monad.Identity` at the top).
3. Wrap all calls to these functions in `runState`.

Here is the fixed up code:

```haskell
import Control.Monad.State
import Control.Monad.Identity

main :: IO ()
main = print $ runFib 7

runFib :: Int -> (Int, Cache)
runFib n = runState (fib n) []

type Cache = [(Int, Int)]

fib :: Int -> State Cache Int
fib 0 = StateT $ \s -> Identity (0, s)
fib 1 = StateT $ \s -> Identity (1, s)
fib n = StateT $ \s ->
    case lookup n s of
      Just v -> Identity (v, s)
      Nothing -> let (r1, s1) = runState (fib (n - 1)) s
                     (r2, s2) = runState (fib (n - 2)) s1
                     r = r1 + r2
                 in Identity (r, (n, r) : s2)
```

We can now run this, and it'll give the result we expect.

```sh
$ runghc fib.hs
(13,[(7,13),(6,8),(5,5),(4,3),(3,2),(2,1)])
```

Alright, let us start simplifying this!

### Monads!

Remember, "State" is a "monad". You don't need to really understand monads to
follow along what's going to happen next - the tl;dr; you can keep in mind is
that if something is a monad, then there are special functions that we can use
to compose values of such types.

The first such function is `pure`. It represents the "simplest" version of a
particular value. In our case, what is the simplest value of type `s -> (a, s)`.
Well, it just needs to return the `a` and not twiddle with the state. But how do
we get an `a`? We pass it to `pure`!

```haskell
-- Snipped for illustrative purposes
pure x = \s -> (x, s)
```

We can use `pure` to simplify the first two clauses of our function definition.

```haskell
fib 0 = pure 0
fib 1 = pure 1
```

If we run the code again after making that change, it'll still give the same
result. That's weird, where did all the surrounding junk go!

It might seem like magic, or something that has a special case in the compiler,
but no, this is all a library level abstraction. Haskell is a gift that'll keep
giving.

Let's continue.

The other pattern that monads support is combining two values. Do something,
take its output, and then something 2 with it. Like a factory line:

<em>something → something 2</em>. Cheeky as Haskellers are, they even created an
arrow like symbol for this: `>>=`. It is called "bind". What it does is, take
the output of the first monad, and feeds it to a function that then something
else with this value to modify it.

So let use this bind `>>=` operator to chain together our steps:

```haskell
fib :: Int -> State Cache Int
fib 0 = pure 0
fib 1 = pure 1
fib n = StateT $ \s ->
    case lookup n s of
      Just v -> Identity (v, s)
      Nothing -> runStateT (fib (n - 1)) s >>= \(r1, s1) ->
                   runStateT (fib (n - 2)) s1 >>= \(r2, s2) ->
                     let r = r1 + r2
                     in Identity (r, (n, r) : s2)
```

I also had to replace `runState` with `runStateT` (Don't fixate too much on the
meaning behind these details and infelicities – in our final version we'll not
be using any of them).

We can run our code again, and see that it still works the same way. To simplify
further, we'll need to start getting into the specific tools provided by the
state monad itself (above and beyond generic monads).

### The State monad

The first thing to notice is at the top of `fib`

```haskell
fib n = StateT $ \s ->
    case lookup n s of
    ...
```

As you can imagine, this'll be a common requirement for functions that deal with
state – read the current value of the state. Of course, the value of the state
is getting passed to us right there, as an input to our function. But we want to
"hide" it away so that it is not always in our face, and somehow access that
value when we need it.

The State monad library provides a function for this task. It is called `get`.
When we call `get`, we don't actually get back a value, we get back a state
monad. However, we already know how to extract values from a monad – by using
the bind operator `>>=`. Let's change our function to use `get`.

```haskell
fib n = get >>= \s ->
    case lookup n s of
```

If we make this change, I'll code will stop compiling though. This is because we
no longer have a regular function that was wrapped in a `StateT`, instead the
code we're writing (`case lookup ...`) now has to return another state monad to
satisfy the type of `>>=`.

To get the compiler to be happy, the code needs to be changed to:

1. Remove `Identity`, and also the tuples with s, and just return the value
   directly wrapped in a `pure`.

2. Remove the `runStateT` and stop passing the state to fib, instead just return
   the fib values themselves (Reminder that `fib x` is actuall a value of type
   `State Cache Int`, which is a state monad, which is what we should be passing
   into and returning from `>>=`).

> I'm not sure how helpful this is being – for people who don't have the
> necessary background these might be arbitrary changes. I'll think of better
> ways of conveying this in the future, but hopefully some of this is sticking.

With these changes, our code becomes:

```haskell
fib :: Int -> State Cache Int
fib 0 = pure 0
fib 1 = pure 1
fib n = get >>= \s ->
    case lookup n s of
      Just v -> pure v
      Nothing -> fib (n - 1) >>= \r1 ->
                   fib (n - 2) >>= \r2 ->
                     let r = r1 + r2
                     in pure r
```

This runs, and produces the correct answer, but our memoization is gone. Of
course. We're only reading the state s, but we're never updating it. The code
looks cleaner, there is no s moving around, but how do we update it now if we
don't have access to it as the input and are not returning it as the output.

For this purpose, `Control.Monad.State` provides another function that returns a
new state monad, but with an updated state. This function is called `put`. Let
us use it to update our state before we return the final result r of our
expression.

> I think keeping in mind that these are just ordinary expressions, and the
> result of an of the expression is result of the branch that we ended up on,
> helps demystify Haskell in general, and monads in particular.

```haskell
fib :: Int -> State Cache Int
fib 0 = pure 0
fib 1 = pure 1
fib n = get >>= \s ->
    case lookup n s of
      Just v -> pure v
      Nothing -> fib (n - 1) >>= \r1 ->
                   fib (n - 2) >>= \r2 ->
                     let r = r1 + r2
                     in put ((n, r) : s) >>= \_ ->
                          pure r
```

In the final result, we're not actually using the value chained from the put,
which is why we ignore it using the underscore wildcard. This is actually a
common thing - sometimes we just want two things to happen one after the other,
but the second thing doesn't use the result of the first. It is so common, that
the Haskell standard library provides a sequence operator `>>` to shorten this
`>>= \_ ->` pattern.

So after changing the last two lines to

```haskell
in put ((n, r) : s) >>
     pure r
```

if we run the code again,

```sh
$ runghc fib.hs
(13,[(7,13)])
```

this time we see that while the state was used, it only contains the table of
the last value, not the intermediate ones.

Perhaps you've already guessed the issue. When we're updating the state using
`put`, we're using the value `s` that we got from the initial `get`. But
remember, Haskell is a pure functional language. There is no mutation, in fact,
there are no variables - the only things we have are bindings. These are not
variables, because they never change, they are just names for things that were
on the call stack.

In our case, when we recursively call fib, the recursive calls will update the
state using `put`. They'll use the correct state to `put` into, because we've
been chaining these state monads together using `>>=` and the library is taking
care that state that was set by the latest `put` is the one that is carried
along the chain.

However, when we get back to the original function (that called the recursive
invocations), we overwrite the state using an old `s` value that doesn't include
the latest changes made by the `put`s in the recursive calls.

The fix is simple. We need to `get` again when `put`ting, so that we update the
latest value.

```haskell
fib n = get >>= \s ->
    case lookup n s of
      Just v -> pure v
      Nothing -> fib (n - 1) >>= \r1 ->
                   fib (n - 2) >>= \r2 ->
                     let r = r1 + r2
                     in get >>= \s2 ->
                       put ((n, r) : s) >>
                         pure r
```

After this change, if we run again, we'll notice all the intermediate values
showing up in our cache (memo) table.

```sh
$ runghc fib.hs
(13,[(7,13),(6,8),(5,5),(4,3),(3,2),(2,1)])
```

As you might imagine, this is a very common requirement - `get`ting the latest
state and modifying it in some way and then `put`ting it back - so
`Control.Monad.State` provides a convenience function for this combination. It
is called, hold your breath, `modify`. Using it, our code becomes:

```haskell
fib n = get >>= \s ->
    case lookup n s of
      Just v -> pure v
      Nothing -> fib (n - 1) >>= \r1 ->
                   fib (n - 2) >>= \r2 ->
                     let r = r1 + r2
                     in modify ((n, r) :) >>
                          pure r
```

Similarly, but in the other direction, at the start of our function we got the
state, but we weren't really interested in the full state, we wanted some
particular part of it. So there is a function called `gets` to query the state
using the provided query function, and only give us the result. We can use it to
directly perform our lookup this way:

```haskell
fib :: Int -> State Cache Int
fib 0 = pure 0
fib 1 = pure 1
fib n = gets (lookup n) >>= \s -> case s of
    Just v -> pure v
    Nothing -> fib (n - 1) >>= \r1 ->
                 fib (n - 2) >>= \r2 ->
                   let r = r1 + r2
                   in modify ((n, r) :) >>
                        pure r
```

Alright! Let's move on to the next stage of our simplification.

### Abstracting memoize

At this point (or even before this), the other tutorials I've seen move on to
using the `do` notation to further simplify things. I feel that is a misstep,
because the `do` notation obscures the fact that everything in Haskell is just
an expression. If we stay in expression-land, things might get nested and hairy,
but it also becomes easier to visually see and then extract common patterns into
reusable abstractions.

> This is not to say one should never use `do`. Sometimes it is fine, and it is
> perhaps even a personal preference.

Instead of `do`, I'm going to go off in the weeds in the other direction, and
start lifting stuff. The word "lift" in Haskell comes from category theory,
specifically functors, and it means that a normal function `a -> b` is "lifted"
into another universe `f a -> f b`.

Apologies for the hand wavey explanation here, but trying to explain lifting in
more detail would sidetrack too much from the focus here. For our specific use
case, the thing I want you to be aware of is that this code:

```haskell
fib (n - 1) >>= \r1 ->
  fib (n - 2) >>= \r2 ->
    let r = r1 + r2
```

is the same as this code:

```haskell
liftM2 (+) (fib (n - 1)) (fib (n - 2)) >>= \r ->
```

That is, we're "lifting" the normal plus operator (+) from acting on `Int` values,
to get them to act on `State Cache Int` values. How Haskell does that is not
essential to know for our purposes here, just that Haskell can automatically do
it for us.

So using `liftM2`, our code becomes:

```haskell
fib n = gets (lookup n) >>= \s -> case s of
    Just v -> pure v
    Nothing -> liftM2 (+) (fib (n - 1)) (fib (n - 2)) >>= \r ->
                 modify ((n, r) :) >> pure r
```

It still runs, and produces the same output as before.

Now comes the great jump. We notice that only some part of our `fib` function
deals with the actual computation, while the rest of it is checking to see if we
already have that cached result. We can make this distinction more apparent by
rewriting the fib function this way:

```haskell
fib n = gets (lookup n) >>= \s -> case s of
    Just v -> pure v
    Nothing -> compute >>= \r -> modify ((n, r) :) >> pure r
  where compute = liftM2 (+) (fib (n - 1)) (fib (n - 2))
```

In fact, we can just pass `compute` as a parameter!

```haskell
fib :: Int -> State Cache Int
fib 0 = pure 0
fib 1 = pure 1
fib n = memo n compute
  where compute = liftM2 (+) (fib (n - 1)) (fib (n - 2))

memo :: Int -> State Cache Int -> State Cache Int
memo n compute = gets (lookup n) >>= \s -> case s of
  Just v -> pure v
  Nothing -> compute >>= \r -> modify ((n, r) :) >> pure r
```

In fact, this same memo will work with all other types of state monads, not just
the `State Cache Int`. The requirement is that the state should be such that we
can `lookup n` and `(n, r) :` on it, but otherwise we can generalize the type
signature.

We can replace the `liftM2` by the more standard, so called, applicative
style `(+) <$> fib (n - 1) <*> fib (n - 2)`. We can also move the memo upwards
so that it also covers the base cases:

```haskell
fib :: Int -> State Cache Int
fib n = memo n (f n) where
  f 0 = pure 0
  f 1 = pure 1
  f n = (+) <$> fib (n - 1) <*> fib (n - 2)

We can also use the `LambdaCase` language extension to remove the noise in the
implementation of memo. With all these changes, our code looks like this:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE LambdaCase #-}

import Control.Monad.State

main :: IO ()
main = print $ runFib 7

runFib :: Int -> (Int, Cache)
runFib n = runState (fib n) []

type Cache = [(Int, Int)]

fib :: Int -> State Cache Int
fib n = memo n (f n) where
  f 0 = pure 0
  f 1 = pure 1
  f n = (+) <$> fib (n - 1) <*> fib (n - 2)

memo :: (MonadState [(a, b)] m, Eq a) => a -> m b -> m b
memo n compute = gets (lookup n) >>= \case
  Just v -> pure v
  Nothing -> compute >>= \r -> modify ((n, r) :) >> pure r
```

We can run it again to ensure that everything looks good:

```haskell
$ runghc fib.hs
(13,[(7,13),(6,8),(5,5),(4,3),(3,2),(2,1)])
```

Finally, since now that we know that the memoization is working, we don't need
to see those intermediate values. We can modify our `runFib` method to return
only the first element of the tuple, say:

```haskell
runFib n = fst $ runState (fib n) []
```

But there is a helper function for doing this too - `evalState`. It is like
`runState`, except it throws away the state and only returns the final result.

```haskell
runFib :: Int -> Int
runFib n = evalState (fib n) []
```

Let's see it in action.

```sh
$ runghc fib.hs
13
```

Nice.

### More to memoization

We've reached quite an okay point. We started with this beauty:

```haskell
fib :: Int -> Int
fib 0 = 0
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)
```

and have ended up with:

```haskell
fib :: Int -> State Cache Int
fib n = memo n (f n) where
  f 0 = pure 0
  f 1 = pure 1
  f n = (+) <$> fib (n - 1) <*> fib (n - 2)
```

Not great, but not too bad. The second version implicitly memoizes all function
calls under the hood, and for problems where memoization is of essence, this is
an okay price to pay for the functionality we get. Indeed, even for the simple
case of our `fib` function, and for (relatively) small values of n - the
difference in time is functionally (pun!) important (try running `fib 700` in
both cases - the first one goes nowhere while the second is instant).

Hope you found this useful.
