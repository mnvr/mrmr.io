### Euclid's algorithm

<C.Box>

<C.Explanation>
Sometimes proclaimed as the oldest algorithm put down on paper, Euclid's
algorithm is enthralling in its recursive simplicity.

Euclid's version used a minus instead of a modulo (%), but otherwise here it is
in its full glory.

</C.Explanation>

```js
const gcd = (n, m) => m ? gcd(m, n % m) : n
```

### Euclidean rhythms

<C.Box>

<C.Explanation>

At the surface level it is calculating the GCD, the largest number that divides
both `n` and `m`. But really it is unravelling a number pair.

In 2005, Godfried Toussaint realized that Euclid's algorithm encodes many drum
beats. For example, here is `E(3, 8)`.

### Code

<C.Box>

<C.Explanation>

Here is an implementation of the algorithm described by Toussaint. At each step,
we "fold" the end of the sequence into the beginning. How much to fold is given
by the value of `gcd(n, m)` at that step.

When we call this function with two numbers (_the number of 1's_, and _the
length of the sequence_), it returns a sequence where the 1's are maximally
displaced. e.g. if you copy paste this code to your browser's developer tools,
and then call `E(3,8)`, you'll get

```
> E(3,8)
[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
```

Somewhat surprisingly, this function is all we need to describe most real world
rhythms.

See [the source code for this
site](https://github.com/mnvr/mrmr.io/blob/main/pages/mj/euclid/test.js) for a
version of this function with comments and more examples.

```js
const E = (k, n) => {
    let s = Array(n).fill(0)
        .map((_, i) => (i < k ? [1] : [0]))

    let d = n - k
    n = Math.max(k, d)
    k = Math.min(k, d)
    let z = d

    while (z > 0 || k > 1) {
        for (let i = 0; i < k; i++)
            s[i].push(...s[s.length - 1 - i])
        s.splice(-k)
        z = z - k
        d = n - k
        n = Math.max(k, d)
        k = Math.min(k, d)
    }

    return s.flat()
}
```
