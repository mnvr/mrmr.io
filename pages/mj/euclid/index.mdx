### Euclid's algorithm

<C.Box>

<C.Explanation>
Sometimes proclaimed as the oldest algorithm put down on paper, Euclid's
algorithm is enthralling in its recursive simplicity.

Euclid's version used a minus instead of a modulo (%), but otherwise here it is
in its full glory.

</C.Explanation>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js
const gcd = (n, m) => m ? gcd(m, n % m) : 1
```

</C.Box>

### Beats

<C.Box>

<C.Explanation>

At the surface level it is calculating the GCD, the largest number that divides
both `n` and `m`. But really it is unravelling a number pair.

In 2005, Godfried Toussaint realized that Euclid's algorithm encodes many of the
"erratic" sounding drum beats used across the world. For example, here is `E(3,
8)`.
