### First sound

<C.Box>

<C.Explanation>

Let's make a sound in JavaScript. Browsers implement WebAudio. WebAudio provides
two ways of making sounds:

1. The simpler way is by connecting a collection of primitive nodes that
   WebAudio provides - these are things like oscillators, barebones IIR filters
   etc.

2. The more advanced way is to use a thing called "AudioWorklet", wherein we
   write code to compute the individual samples themselves.

Let's make a sound using the first method.

Hello world
