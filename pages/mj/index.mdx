### First sound

<C.Box>

<C.Explanation>

Let's make a sound in JavaScript. Browsers implement WebAudio. WebAudio provides
two ways of making sounds:

1. The simpler way is by connecting a collection of primitive nodes that
   WebAudio provides - these are things like oscillators, barebones IIR filters
   etc.

2. The more advanced way is to use a thing called "AudioWorklet", wherein we
   write code to compute the individual samples themselves.

Let's make a sound using the first method.

</C.Explanation>

```
const ctx = new AudioContext()
ctx.resume()

const osc = new OscillatorNode(ctx)
// Reduce volume, the default is too loud!
const mix = new GainNode(ctx, { gain: 0.1 })
osc.connect(mix).connect(ctx.destination)
osc.start()
```

### Beeps

<C.Box>

<C.Explanation>

Instead of clicking the button ourselves, let us ask the computer to click it
for us.

In music, a second is like an eternity. Events in music happen at the time scale
of tens of milliseconds, and there are a _thousand_ milliseconds in a second.

Events in music are called notes. We can easily hear around 16 of them in a
second.
