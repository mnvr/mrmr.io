brew install python3

https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python

There is an existing python3 in /usr/local installed as part of macOS Command
Line tools, you can ignore that. The shell also ignores it because /opt/homebrew
appears earlier in the PATH.

To work with Jupyter (formerly IPython Notebook) Notebooks in VS Code, we need
to activate a Python environment in which we've installed the Jupyter package.

> if you'd prefer not to use Anaconda or Miniconda, you can create a Python
> virtual environment and install the packages needed for the tutorial using
> pip. If you go this route, you will need to install the following packages:
> pandas, jupyter, seaborn, scikit-learn, keras, and tensorflow.

(Optional) Create a new profile in VS Code to isolate the extensions to the
current workspace.

Workspace to profile association is automatic?

Install the Python and Jupyter VSCode extensions (both from Microsoft)

https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html

A Python venv is a virtual environment that allows us to install packages
without installing them globally.

Create a new venv

    python3 -m venv .venv                   # create a new virtual environment
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip    # optional step - upgrade pip if needed
                                            # pip is the python package manager
    source ./.venv/bin/activate             # activate it

    https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment

We could run these commands ourselves, the end result will be the same.

Any extensions we install now will live in teh local .venv folder. Now open a
new integrated terminal to install the (Python) packages we need. We can even do
it in a terminal outside of VS Code, just activate the environment first (source
./.venv/bin/activate) - the integrated terminal just does that automatically at
startup if it notices a virtual env lying around.

https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_how-the-extension-chooses-an-environment-automatically

When in the venv we'll be able to use the python command instead of the python3
command.

Running cells with '.venv' requires the ipykernel package.
Run the following command to install 'ipykernel' into the Python environment.
Command: '/Users/m/Desktop/p/Python/.venv/bin/python -m pip install ipykernel -U --force-reinstall'

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-Kernels-and-the-Jupyter-Extension#python-extension-and-ipykernel

pip install ipython ipykernel

In particular, we don't need to install the Jupyter package itself
