VS Code has native integration with Jupyter notebooks. That means we can run
Jupyter notebooks inside of VS Code without running the Jupyter server.

Steps:

1. Install Python
2. Install the Python and Jupyter VS Code extensions
3. Create a venv
4. Install any notebook related packages in this venv
5. Start your notebook

#### 1. Install Python

On macOS <E.RefLink href="https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python" />

```
brew install python3
```

There is an existing `python3` in `/usr/local` installed as part of macOS
Command Line tools, we can ignore that. The shell also ignores it because
`/opt/homebrew` appears earlier in the `PATH`.

After this, Python will be available to us under the name "python3", not
"python". This is fine, we'll fix this below when we create a <i>venv</i>.

#### 2. Install the Python and Jupyter VS Code extensions

##### (Optional) Create a new profile

We can create a new profile in VS Code to isolate the extensions to the current
workspace. Create a new folder somewhere, I called it "Python", and open it in
VS Code. This folder will serve as our workspace.

Now run the "Profiles: Create Profile..." command in VS Code. Use the default
profile as the basis.

The workspace to profile association is automatic <E.RefLink
href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75340086/binding-vscode-profiles-to-a-workspace"
/>, so anytime we open this folder, this profile will get activated, and any
extensions we install when in this profile will be activated too.

##### (Then) Install VS Code extensions

Install the Python and Jupyter VS Code extensions – both are from Microsoft.

#### 3. Create a venv

A Python _venv_ is a virtual environment that allows us to install packages
without installing them globally <E.RefLink
href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" />.

In VS Code we can do that by running the "Python: Create Environment" command.

Under the hood, or if we want to manually create a new venv, this is what it
does <E.RefLink
href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments"
/>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<pre className="language-sh">
<code className="mrmr-code-comment"># create a new virtual environment</code><br/>
<code>python3 -m venv .venv</code><br/>
<br/>
<code className="mrmr-code-comment"># optional step - upgrade pip if needed</code><br/>
<code className="mrmr-code-comment"># pip is the python package manager</code><br/>
<code>python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip</code><br/>
<br/>
<code className="mrmr-code-comment"># activate it</code><br/>
<code>source ./.venv/bin/activate</code>
</pre>

We could run these commands ourselves, the end result will be the same.

VS Code will also helpfully activate the venv (the last command above) whenever
we open this workspace again, or open a new integrated terminal inside
it <E.RefLink href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments"/>. If
we want to activate the venv manually, say if we open an external Terminal to
this folder, we can run `source ./.venv/bin/activate`.

Any packages we install now will live in the local .venv directory in our
workspace.

Nicely, when we're, in the venv we'll be able to use the `python` command instead
of the `python3` command since the venv creates a symlink for it. This is also a
good way to check that we're indeed in an active venv (although the shell prompt
should also have updated):

```
(.venv) $ which python
.../.venv/bin/python
```

#### 4. Install any notebook related packages in this venv

This step is optional, because when we create a new notebook later on and try to
run a code block in it, VS Code will ask us to select a "kernel" (think of them
as supported language packs) to run the code, and when we'll select our Python
venv, it'll helpfully also ask us if we want to install the Python packages that
provide the kernel.

But if we want to, we can install these packages manually beforehand <E.RefLink
href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/data-science-tutorial" />

> “To work with Jupyter (formerly IPython Notebook) Notebooks in VS Code, we
> need to activate a Python environment in which we've installed the Jupyter
> package.”

by running the following command:

```sh
pip install ipython ipykernel
```

Note in particular that we didn't need to install the Jupyter (Python) package
itself <E.RefLink href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-Kernels-and-the-Jupyter-Extension#python-extension-and-ipykernel" />.

The VS Code data science tutorial<E.RefLink
href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/data-science-tutorial"
/> also mention other packages that we might want to pip install in the future:

> “if you'd prefer not to use Anaconda or Miniconda, you can create a Python
> virtual environment and install the packages needed for the tutorial using
> pip. If you go this route, you will need to install the following packages:
> pandas, jupyter, seaborn, scikit-learn, keras, and tensorflow.”

### 5. Create New Jupyter Notebook

Use the "Create: New Jupyter Notebook" command to create a new `.ipynb` file.
The first and only cell in the blank notebook should be selected, as indicated
by the highlight in its left gutter. Press <key>Enter</key> to run the
"Notebook: Edit Cell" command.

The cursor will be inside the cell now. Type "hello". Press <key>Ctrl -
Enter</key> to run the "Notebook: Execute Cell" command.

VS Code will ask you to select the kernel. Select the venv we created
previously.

That's it. We can now interactively type and run Python code in this REPL / file
mixture.
