Is the meaning of piece of text in the words themselves, or in the relationships
between? Or in the context in which the text appears? Or on the subtext, the
author, their intent, the medium?

I created a page to explore this.

It contains various snippets of texts that I read somewhere and found
interesting. I didn't write them, though I freely edited them on whims. I don't
agree with them (whatever they mean), I just found them interesting at that
time.

I put all of them together, and linked them by the words common between them.
Perhaps I'll keep adding more quotes to it in the future too.

Hope you find reading and clicking around the page enjoyable, maybe even
evocative. Without further ado, [here's the link to it](/quotes).
