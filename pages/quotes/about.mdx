Is the meaning of a text in the words themselves, or in their relationships? Is
it in the context in which a text appears? The author, their intent, the medium?

I created a page to explore this.

It contains various snippets of texts that I read somewhere and found
interesting. I didn't write them, though I've freely edited some on whims. I
don't agree with them (whatever they mean), they are more like food to
decontextualize.

I put all of them together, and linked them by the words common between them.
I'll keep adding more quotes to it.

Hope you findÂ reading and clicking around the page enjoyable, maybe even
evocative. Without further ado, [here's the link to it](/quotes).
