Is the meaning of a text in the words themselves, or in their relationships? Is
it in the context in which a text appears? The author, their intent, the medium?

I created a <Link to="/quotes">page</Link> to explore this.

It contains various snippets of texts that I read somewhere and found
interesting. I didn't write them, though I've freely edited some on whims. I
don't necessarily agree with them (whatever they mean), they are more like food
to decontextualize.

They quotes are linked by the words common between them. I'll keep adding more
to the page.

Hope you findÂ reading and clicking around the page enjoyable, maybe even
evocative. <Link to="/quotes">Here's the link to it again</Link>.
