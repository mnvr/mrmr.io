### What is a raag?

A raag in Indian music is similar to a scale in Western music.

I think of raags as lying between two extremes:

1. A bag of notes that go well together.

2. A well-known melody.

The first one is known as a _thaat_ in Indian music, and a _mode_ in Western
music.

> I'm simplifying a bit, as I am in the rest of the explanation.

The second one you understand - it like some well-known strand of music, a
common motif / refrain / riff that people then start creating variations of.

Both raags and scales lie somewhere between these two extremes, but raags veer
more towards the second extreme. At the same time, they're not just fixed riffs.
Instead, they are more like, say, Markov chains that describe how a piece of
music in that raag will grow, possibly indefinitely.

Each rendition of a raag, at the hands or the voice of a capable musician, is a
unique instantiation of this pattern.

They're still formal, except this formal structure is not written down, it is
passed in an oral tradition from teachers to students.

People try to categorize them, give them names etc so that they're easier to
talk about. This is very useful, but it is akin to the relationship of grammar
with language - language does not arise from the grammar written down in
textbooks, it is the other way around, grammars try to capture the gist of
living languages.

### What is a thaat?

The raags that I'm illustrating are actually _thaats_. That is, there is a
_Bhairav thaat_ (a _thaat_ being a set of 7 out of the 12 notes). From this same
set of 7 notes can be formed many raags, one of which incidentally in this case
is the _Bhairav raag_.

The ladder representation of the intervals between the notes is visualizing the
_Bhairav thaat_, not the _Bhairav raag_. The raga has more structure and rules
as compared to the thaat, but I haven't yet found a good way to visualize the
raag itself.

As another example, the illustration of _raag Yaman_ is actually
illustrating the _Kalyan thaat_.

Since these illustrations are aimed to encourage people to make music, not to be
an authoritative source, I have traded inaccuracy (by not mentioning the thaats)
for a more beginner friendly presentation.

### How do I convert a raag to Western notes?

This is perhaps the only useful question on this page. Most instruments that
amateurs have access to today are based on Western notes, so being able to
convert raags to Western notes enables more people to play them.

The Indian music tradition employs a movable set of notes. These notes are
uttered aloud as:

<C.Notes>Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni</C.Notes>

But they don't map to a fixed frequency. Nor is there any correspondence to a
western note like C or A.

Instead, what these notes describe is distances, or intervals. We can then pick
any frequency, or any western note, as our starting note (the _Sa_), and then
the rest of the sequence can be one-to-one mapped to the corresponding western
notes starting from that point.

Above we listed the 7 major notes. There are also 5 minor ones, for a total of 12. All 12 in sequence are sometimes notated as:

<C.Notes>S r R g G m M P d D n N</C.Notes>

So suppose we want to start with the note A on the guitar (say, A2, the open
second string). We will _move_ our sequence of 12 notes so that our starting
(root) note, _S_, corresponds to A. Then, it is a one-to-one mapping:

<C.Mapping1 />

That's it.

### You didn't convert the raag?!

That was left as an exercise for the reader :)

But let's do one example. Let's take the _Bhairav thaat_. If you look around on
the internet, you'll find that it consists of the following notes:

<C.Notes>S r G m P d N</C.Notes>

Let's put these within the sequence of all 12 notes, focusing on the ones that
form the thaat.

<C.BhairavNotes />

Then let's include the mapping table from above. I've also included the distance
from the root note.

<C.Mapping2 />

Finally, we can read off corresponding western notes.

<C.Notes>
    A A<sup>#</sup> C<sup>#</sup> D E F G<sup>#</sup>
</C.Notes>

Since our mapping table used A as the root note, so these are the western notes
corresponding to Bhairav thaat played with A as the root note. We can repeat the
same exercise to get the raag from any other starting note too.
