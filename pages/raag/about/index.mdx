A raag in Indian music is similar to a scale in Western music.

It is however a more nebulous concept. I think of raags as lying between
two extremes.

1. A bag of notes that go well together.

2. A well-known melody.

The first one is known as a _thaat_ in Indian music, and a _mode_ in Western
music.

> I'm simplifying a bit, as I am in the rest of the explanation.

The second one you understand - it like some well-known strand of music, a
common motif / refrain / riff that people then start creating variations of.

Both raags and scales lie somewhere between these two extremes, but raags veer
more towards the second extreme. But they're not just fixed riffs. Instead, they
are more like Markov chains that describe how a piece of music in that raag will
grow, possibly indefinitely.

Each rendition of a raag, at the hands or the voice of a learned musician, is a
unique instantiation of this pattern.

They're still formal, except this formal structure is not written down, it is
passed in an oral tradition from teachers to students.

People try to categorize them, give them names etc so that they're easier to
talk about. This is very useful, but it is akin to the relationship of grammar
with language - language does not arise from the grammar written down in
textbooks, it is the other way around, grammars try to capture the gist of
living languages.

The raags that I'm illustrating are actually _thaats_. That is, there is a
_Bhairav thaat_ (a _thaat_ being a set of 7 out of the 12 notes), and within
this thaat we can have many raags, one of which is called the _Bhairav raag_.

The ladder representation of the intervals between the notes is visualizing the
_Bhairav thaat_, not the _Bhairav raag_ - I don't know of a good way to
visualize the raag itself.

Since these illustrations are aimed to encourage people to make music, not to be
an authoritative source, I moved this formal distinction here in the detailed
notes instead of adding more verbiage to the illustrations themselves.
