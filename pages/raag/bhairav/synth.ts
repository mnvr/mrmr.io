/**
 * Frequency expressed as the MIDI note
 *
 * Even though we don't use MIDI, this is a convenient way of specifying musical
 * notes because integral MIDI notes correspond to semitones.
 *
 * Integral values correspond to semitones. It is totally fine to specify
 * fractional values too to get arbitrary frequencies - even then, specifying
 * notes this way is convenient because of the implicit logarithmic nature (we
 * get a new octave every thirteenth MIDI note).
 *
 * For example, MIDI note 69 corresponds to A4, 440 Hz.
 *
 * This value should be between 21 (A0, 27.5 Hz) and 108 (C8, 4186 Hz),
 * inclusive.
 *
 * If you're new to seeing MIDI numbers, the following might be helpful:
 *
 * - An octave is a ratio of 2:1. Two notes, where one is double the frequency
 *   of the other, are an octave apart.
 *
 * - An octave is divided into 12 equal semitones (this is controversial, but
 *   that's how it gets done de facto). So the difference between two notes that
 *   are just one semitone apart is 1/12th of an octave. However, human hearing,
 *   and musical notes, are logarithmic - which means that instead of linear
 *   differences we perceive ratios (and thus in music use ratios). So a more
 *   accurate statement is that the _ratio_ between two notes that are just one
 *   semitone apart is 1/12th of an octave.
 *
 * - So we need to find a ratio r such that if we multiply by it 12 times (once
 *   each for the 12 notes in an octave), we get back 2. This is 2 ^ (1/12), the
 *   12th root of 2.
 *
 *         $ python3 -c 'print(2 ** (1/12))'
 *         1.0594630
 *
 * - So each semitone has the ratio 1.059.
 *
 * - Conveniently, each MIDI number corresponds to a semitone. Two common
 *   reference points are MIDI 60, which corresponds to "middle C", C4, 261.3
 *   Hz; and MIDI 69, which corresponds to musical note A4, 440 Hz.
 *
 * - The range of MIDI numbers is conventionally capped to match a hypothetical
 *   piano that ranges from note A0 (MIDI 21, 27.5 Hz) to C8 (MIDI 108, 4186
 *   Hz).
 *
 * - To convert MIDI notes to frequencies, 69 is taken as the reference value.
 *   Then we just multiply (or divide) by 1.059 (i.e. 2^(1/12)) as many times as
 *   is needed to get from 69 to the given note.
 *
 * There are other good explanations too available online. e.g. this one from
 * UNSW: [Note names, MIDI numbers and
 * frequencies](https://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/notes.html).
