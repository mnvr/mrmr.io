The IO monad in Haskell, and declarative style of UI programming popularized by
React, have the same essence — instead of writing the program that does what we
want, we write a program _that_ writes the program that does what we want.

In both these contexts, this same essence was arrived at from two almost
opposite directions — in React from the jungle of JavaScript practice, in
Haskell from the mathematics of Category theory.

---

Let’s start with React. I feel React is under-appreciated. Every year there is
someone who goes out and announces that React is dead. Every year React goes
stronger. Its influence is so pervasive, almost transparent at this point, so
much so that the people who’re dissing React often don’t realize that they
themselves are using a framework which is also a (sometimes even WIP) copy of
React.

The basic insight of React is the oldest trick in the programming book - solving
a problem by adding another level of indirection. Instead of writing the UI, let
us write a description that'll then be used to generate the UI.

The unique bit with React is that our description is not meant as a DSL that
simplifies writing the UI itself (though React does that too, with JSX). What it
simplifies is managing state. The most important part of our description is the
part where we explicitly tell React which UI element depends on which “source of
truth”.

React then takes our description and creates the actual UI shown to the user. If
we consider the UI as a tree of nested components, there are now _two_ trees:

- the view tree (what we wrote)
- the render tree (what React constructs from the view tree)

Since we explicitly told React what element in our view tree depends on which
state, when the state changes, it knows exactly which part of the render tree it
needs to update. Interestingly, the view tree doesn't change! (we'll see how
this is similar to the Haskell way of doing IO).

The thing we get out of all this roundaboutness is *composability*.

Many experienced programmers try to architect their code such that it is
composable, because they know that once they have elements that can be composed
without thinking of the combinatorial explosion of the interaction between
individual parts of the composition, they can build arbitrarily complex
structures.

So it is quite elementary, wanting composability. The issue is - composability
is really, really, hard to get in practice. Seeking composability backfires
often, and is one of the reasons why over-engineering happens — experienced
programmers have experienced the power of composition, and want to recreate that
in their own architecture, but they end up designing something that doesn’t
_quite_ compose, there is that leaky abstraction somewhere, and the end result
is an over-engineered mess compared to what they could've written if they had
eschewed the abstraction.

What React was able to do was achieve this composability in practice.

The proof of the pudding is in the pie. The "React way" has not only consumed
the web world, the two main ways of writing mobile UIs, SwiftUI and Flutter, are
copies of React.

Here is Hello world in React

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js
function Counter() {
  const [c, setC] = useState(0)
  const handleClick = () => setC(c + 1)
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>{c}</button>
}
```

And here it is in SwiftUI

```swift
struct Counter: View {
    @State var c = 0
    var body: some View {
        Button("\(c)") { c = c + 1 }
    }
}
```

And here in Flutter

```dart
class Counter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  State<Counter> createState() => _CounterState();
}

class _CounterState extends State<Counter> {
  int _c = 0;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return TextButton(
        onPressed: () { setState(() { _c++; }); },
        child: Text('$_c'));
  }
}
```

Maybe you can see what I meant by the _WIP_ quip earlier.

To be clear, there are many problems with React, the _library_, and great
reasons to use an alternative. But React, the _idea_, has absolutely been
revolutionary. In fact, React has been its own enemy in a sense - because of the
composability it offers, people have been building bigger things with it at a
faster rate than the surrounding ecosystem can provide the tools to handle.

As an aside, React didn’t click for me until I saw [this talk by Dan
Abramov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpw9EHDh2bM&t=687). My mind was blown
when I saw it: Watching it, as it sank it, I felt like I had gained a
superpower, and that I could now build any UI that I wanted without worrying
about it collapsing under its own combinatorial complexity.

While hooks and function components are an evolution of the same library, to me
there was something smothering about the class based approach. I feel it is only
with function components that React, the idea, finally come to its full
frutition.

There are traces of this division in the copies too. Flutter forked React before
function components were the vibe, and so it still lives on in the class based
(and in my opinion, inferior) approach. SwiftUI forked after function
components, and that’s the DNA it reflects.

All that said, a big shock for me was when someone I admire, and who is much
more productive than me, said that they prefer the class based React components.
They said they find those simpler to understand.

I still don’t know what to make of it. It sort of undermines the core point of
this whole article really - that great abstractions are priceless. I thought
I’ll mention that anecdote to acknowledge that whatever I’m saying is far from a
universally held opinion.

Haskell had a problem. How do you even do I/O in a purely functional language?

To some, this might seem like an unsolvable problem. So much so that some
people, including past me, thought it was an unsolvable problem even after
having come into contact with Haskell - I thought that with all the IO monad
shonad shenanigans, Haskellers were just trying to pull one on me.

After all, there just isn't a way to do a non-referentially-transparent IO
operations in a pure language, right? So for the longest time I thought the IO
monad stuff is just obfuscation to hide this inability.

I was wrong. There is a way a purely functional program can deal with IO nicely.
It is the same way React deals with state. We don’t write a program that does
IO. We write a program that describes a second program that does the actual IO.

You see, Haskell is actually two languages, just like how React was two trees -
a (pure) view tree and an (imperative) render tree. There is Haskell itself, the
pure language, and then there is a Haskell runtime that is a normal C like
imperative language. This second language doesn't actually exist - GHC, the
Haskell compiler is smart enough to directly compile to machine code, but
conceptually we can think of the Haskell program we write as driving the actions
in a second, imperative program that actually gets executed.

Consider listing the contents of a directory (thanks to #haskell IRC for this
example). Does the ls command contain the contents of the directory? No, of
course not. When we run the ls command, it goes and gets the current contents
the directory, but the ls command itself doesn’t have this data in it. The ls
command is a function we have to call to get the data, and calling it again and
again might return different results.

In Haskell, this is modelled as the following (hypothetical) function, ls:

```hs
ls :: RealWorld -> ([String], RealWorld)
```

Haskell notation might be unfamiliar to some of you, and the notation itself is
not the focus here, so let me write it in a form that might be similar to the
more conventional languages:

```
func ls(realWorld) -> (Array<String>, RealWorld)
```

Now let us say we want to write another function that counts the number of files
in a directory. To do this, we might try doing (in our fake-pseudo Haskell):

```
func lsCount() {
   let files = ls()
   return length(files)
}
```

Most programming languages will do something of that sort. But the above code
won’t work in Haskell, because `ls` takes an argument, which we’re not passing
to it. So instead our function should be something like this:

```
func lsCount(realWorld) {
    let files = ls(realWorld)
    return length(files)
}
```

As you can imagine, passing this `realWorld` around becomes cumbersome, to the
point of impractical, very soon. Which is why most programming languages just
have a `ls()` function (or, say, a `random()`) function that you can call from
anywhere without giving it any input, and can still expecting a different output
(those are not pure functions thus).

That’s where monads come into the picture. [The monad tutorial
fallacy](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/abstraction-intuition-and-the-monad-tutorial-fallacy/)
really is real, so I won’t try to explain monads here. I’ll just leave it at -
you can think of them as an elaborate macro system for passing this `realWorld`
around.

In fact, that’s another similarity to React. React can be written in full by
hand, but it gets cumbersome quite soon, so a part of the practical popularity
of React comes because of JSX, which is an elaborate macro system built on top
of JavaScript. The "React-y code" we write, JSX, is transformed by compilers
like Babel into the actual JavaScript that gets sent to the browser.

This same pattern also happened in SwiftUI. Since around Swift 4, the main
driving force behind the priority log of Swift language features (and I don’t
think Apple will admit this publicly) has been changing the language enough so
that SwiftUI can be expressed in it. For example, out of nowhere (it seemed at
the time they were introduced), the Swift team added support for something
called “ViewBuilders” which are (practically) necessary for writing SwiftUI in
Swift, similar to how React practically needs JSX transformers.

---

This applicability of these concepts is not infinite. Certain higher level
patterns, e.g. navigation, are hard to capture in React (and by extension, in
Flutter and SwiftUI). Of course, people have come up with solutions, but it's
not always entirely obvious how to go about it if one just uses the primitives
that React offers.

Similarly, in the Haskell world, such a limit rears its head in the fact that
while monads enable composability, monads themselves are not composable (for any
pitchforking Haskellers about to impale me - I mean monads are not composable
the same way that two functors are). There have been all sorts of attempts at
fixing this - Monad Transformers, Effect systems - and some work better than
others (depending on who you ask too), but nothing really with the same "click"
that Eugenio Moggi provided to the Haskell community when he discovered that
Monads can be used to model effects like IO.

Ending this post, I don’t have a conclusion to draw. I like Haskell, and to me,
it is the best Lisp around today (even though it is not a Lisp); it is the
language that SICP should be taught in at MIT. I like React, and especially when
used with Typescript, I love the sense of power and pleasantness it gives me. By
highlighting the connection that I see between them, I hope I can get some
people to appreciate one or both of them more.
