The IO monad in Haskell, and declarative style of UI programming popularized by
React, have the same essence — instead of writing the program that does what we
want, we write a program _that_ writes the program that does what we want.

In both these contexts, this same essence was arrived at from two almost
opposite directions — in React from the jungle of JavaScript practice, in
Haskell from the mathematics of Category theory.

---

Let’s start with React. I feel React is under-appreciated. Every year there is
someone who goes out and announces that React is dead. Every year React goes
stronger. Its influence is so pervasive, almost transparent at this point, so
much so that the people who’re dissing React often don’t realize that they
themselves are using a framework which is also a (sometimes WIP) copy of
React.

The basic insight of React is the good old programming trick: solving a problem
by adding a level of indirection. Instead of writing the UI, let us write a
description that'll then be used to generate the UI.

The unique bit with React is that our description is not meant as a DSL that
simplifies writing the UI itself (though it also does that). What it simplifies
is managing state. The most important part of our description is where we
explicitly tell React which UI element depends on which “source of truth”.

React then takes our description and creates the actual UI shown to the user. If
we consider the UI as a tree of nested components, there are now _two_ trees:

-   the view tree (what we wrote)
-   the render tree (what React constructs from the view tree)

Since we explicitly told React what element in our view tree depends on which
state, when the state changes, it knows exactly which part of the render tree it
needs to update. Interestingly, the view tree doesn't change! (we'll see how
this is similar to the Haskell way of doing IO).

The thing we get out of all this roundaboutness is _composability_.

Many experienced programmers try to architect their code such that it is
composable, because they know that once they have elements that can be composed
without thinking of the combinatorial explosion of the interaction between
individual parts of the composition, they can build arbitrarily complex
structures.

So it is quite elementary, wanting composability. The issue is – composability
is really, really, hard to get in practice. Seeking composability backfires
often, and is one of the reasons why over-engineering happens — experienced
programmers have experienced the power of composition, and want to recreate that
in their own architecture, but they end up designing something that doesn’t
_quite_ compose, there is that leaky abstraction somewhere, and the end result
is an over-engineered mess compared to what they could've written if they had
eschewed the abstraction.

What React was able to do was achieve this composability in practice. And the
proof of the pudding is the pie. The "React way" has not only consumed the web
world, the two main ways of writing mobile UIs, SwiftUI and Flutter, are copies
of React.

Here is hello world in React:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js
function Counter() {
  const [c, setC] = useState(0)
  const handleClick = () => setC(c + 1)
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>{c}</button>
}
```

In SwiftUI:

```swift
struct Counter: View {
    @State var c = 0
    var body: some View {
        Button("\(c)") { c = c + 1 }
    }
}
```

And in Flutter:

```dart
class Counter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  State<Counter> createState() => _CounterState();
}

class _CounterState extends State<Counter> {
  int _c = 0;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return TextButton(
        onPressed: () { setState(() { _c++; }); },
        child: Text('$_c'));
  }
}
```

Maybe you can see what I meant by the _WIP_ quip earlier.

To be clear, there are many problems with React, the _library_, and great
reasons to use an alternative. But React, the _idea_, has been revolutionary. In
fact, React has been its own enemy in a sense - because of the composability it
offers, people have been building bigger things with it at a faster rate than
the surrounding ecosystem can provide the tools to handle, leading to programmer
frustration.

React, _the idea_, has a problem too - its simplicity is beguiling. Those of you
who've been shot by well meaning but clueless consistency police with their
state management silver bullets would know what I mean.

As an aside, React didn’t click for me until I saw [this talk by Dan
Abramov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpw9EHDh2bM&t=687). As it sank in, I
felt like I had gained a superpower, and that I could now build any UI that I
wanted without worrying about it collapsing under its own combinatorial
complexity.

While hooks and function components are an evolution of the same concept, there
was something smothering about the class based approach for me. I feel it is
only with function components that React, the idea, finally come to its full
fruition.

There are traces of this evolution in the copies too. Flutter forked React
before function components were the vibe, and so it still lives on in the class
based (and in my opinion, inferior) approach. SwiftUI forked after function
components, and that’s the DNA it reflects.

All that said, a big shock for me was when someone I admire, and who is more
productive than me, told me that they prefer the class based React components.
They said they find those simpler to understand.

I still don’t know what to make of it. It sort of undermines the point of my
post really - that great abstractions are priceless. I thought I’ll mention that
anecdote to acknowledge that whatever I’m saying is far from a universally held
opinion.

Haskell had a problem. How do you even do I/O in a purely functional language?

To some, and I was one of them, this might seem like an unsolvable problem.
There just isn't a way to do referentially opaque IO operations in a pure
language, right? So for the longest time I thought the IO monad shonad
shenanigans are just obfuscation to hide this inability.

I was wrong. There is a way a purely functional program can deal with IO. It is
the same way React deals with state. Don’t write a program that does IO, write a
program that describes a second program that does the actual IO.

You see, Haskell is actually two languages, just like how React was two trees -
a (pure) view tree and an (imperative) render tree. There is Haskell itself, the
pure language, and then there is a Haskell runtime that is a normal C like
imperative language. This second language doesn't actually exist - GHC, the
Haskell compiler is smart enough to directly compile to machine code, but
conceptually we can think of the Haskell program we write as driving the actions
in a second, imperative program that actually gets executed.

Consider listing the contents of a directory (shout-out to
[/r/haskell](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/18vkivp/comment/kfu9cfx/)
for this example). Does the ls command contain the contents of the directory?
No, of course not. When we run the ls command, it goes and gets the current
contents the directory, but the ls command itself doesn’t have this data in it.
The ls command is a thus like a function we have to call to get the data, and
calling it again and again might return different results.

In Haskell, this is modelled as the following (hypothetical) function, ls:

```hs
ls :: RealWorld -> ([String], RealWorld)
```

Haskell notation might be unfamiliar to some of you, and since the notation
itself is not the focus here, let me write that in a form that is similar to the
more conventional languages:

```
func ls(realWorld) -> (Array<String>, RealWorld)
```

Now let us say we want to write another function that counts the number of files
in a directory. To do this, we might try doing (in our fake-pseudo Haskell):

```
func lsCount() {
   let files = ls()
   return length(files)
}
```

Most programming languages will do something of that sort. But the above code
won’t work in Haskell, because `ls` takes an argument, which we’re not passing
to it. So instead our function should be something like this:

```
func lsCount(realWorld) {
    let files = ls(realWorld)
    return length(files)
}
```

As you can imagine, passing this `realWorld` around becomes cumbersome, to the
point of impractical, very soon. Which is why most programming languages just
have a `ls()` function (or, say, a `random()`) function that you can call from
anywhere without giving it any input, and can still expecting a different output
(and that is why those are not pure functions).

That’s where monads come into the picture. [The monad tutorial
fallacy](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/abstraction-intuition-and-the-monad-tutorial-fallacy/)
is real, so I won’t try to explain monads here. I’ll just leave it at - you can
think of them as an elaborate macro system for passing this `realWorld` around.

In fact, that’s another similarity to React. React can be written out in full by
hand, but it gets cumbersome quite soon, so a part of the practical popularity
of React comes because of JSX, which is an elaborate macro system built on top
of JavaScript. The "React-y code" we write, JSX, is transformed by compilers
like Babel into the actual JavaScript that gets sent to the browser.

This same pattern also happened in SwiftUI. I feel that, since around Swift 4,
the main driving force behind the priority log of Swift language features has
been changing the language enough so that SwiftUI can be expressed in it. For
example, out of nowhere (it seemed at the time they were introduced), the Swift
team added support for something called “ViewBuilders” which were practically
necessary for writing SwiftUI in Swift, similar to how React practically needs
JSX transformers.

This applicability of these concepts is not infinite. Certain higher level
patterns, e.g. navigation, are hard to capture in React (and by extension, in
SwiftUI and Flutter). Of course, people have come up with solutions, but it's
not always entirely obvious how to go about it if one just uses the primitives
that React offers.

Similarly, in the Haskell world, such a limit rears its head in the fact that
_while_ monads enable composability, monads _themselves_ are not composable (for
any pitchforking Haskellers about to impale me: I mean monads are not composable
the same way that, say, two functors, are). And here too, people have have come
up with solutions - Monad Transformers, Effect systems - and some work better
than others (depending on who you ask too), but they are extensions to the base
simplicity with which monads model IO, not evolutions of it.

Ending this post, I don’t have a conclusion to draw. I like Haskell, and to me,
it is the best Lisp around today (even though it is not a Lisp); it is the
language that SICP should be taught in at MIT. I like React, and especially when
used with Typescript, I love the sense of power and pleasantness it gives me. By
highlighting the connection that I see between them, I hope I can get some
people to appreciate one or both of them more.
