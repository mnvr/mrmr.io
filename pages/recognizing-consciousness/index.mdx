I've noticed that small flies don't notice me. This is different from, say,
birds, who do notice me.

At some point in time, animals learnt to recognize humans as a threat. Where is
hidden the book in which they wrote this down so that their children know of it,
I don't know, but they know.

Birds notice me as an entity similar to their own self. One that is not
following mechanistic laws and can be the initiator of uninitiated action. Flies
aren't like that â€“ they notice me just how they would notice a windmill, a thing
that is moving, but not as an entity that can intentionally harm them.

_Consciousness recognizes consciousness_. Animals recognize our consciousness,
and I've taken this as a sign of their consciousness. When, or if, artificial
intelligences become conscious, we will similarly know.

It is funny that animals consider us a threat, because we, extrapolating from
myself, are extraordinarily clumsy. We cannot match most animals in direct
confrontation. Then why do they fear us? Do they fear the depths that they see
in our scheming eyes, and are afraid of a conscious entity whose depth they
cannot comprehend? Or do they just fear us the same way we don't go near
bee-hives?

**When AI becomes conscious, we will know.** Whether we'll see unfathomable
depth in their eyes, or they in ours, or whether we'll see each other as equals,
time will tell. But we will know.
