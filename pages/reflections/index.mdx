I don't exist<br/>
But in your imagination<br/>
You don't exist<br/>
But in mine<br/>
Nowhere else<br/>
Do we exist<br/>
But in each other's minds

The moon is but the sun's<br/>
Shining reflection<br/>
Your eyes<br/>
Mine<br/>
I don't exist<br/>
I'm a figment of your imagination<br/>
You don't exist<br/>
But in mine
