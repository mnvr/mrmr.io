Animals (people) have critical periods. e.g. a baby chick will imprint whatever
is moving around in its environment after hatching as their mother.

It is not as drastic in humans, but it does happen. Two well studied examples:

-   Vocal accents are imprinted in the formative years of a child.

-   Children with cataracts, if left untreated in their formative years, remain
    blind even if the cataracts are removed later (the eyes can see, but the
    brain can't).

Critical periods have measurable neurobiological markers. Psychologically it
seems that the brain is more "open" for some modality during its corresponding
critical period.

Instead of encoding a behaviour in the gene itself, what gets encoded is the
ability to learn that behaviour from the environment at particular times. e.g.,
instead of encoding a particular language and vocal accent in the genes, the
brain learns these from its environment during a critical period.

Not only does this save on genetic space, this is also arguably more adaptive to
changes in the environment. For example. an immigrant's child has to live in
their new environment, so it is better they pick up their new environment's
language and accent instead of the ones they might've (hypothetically) gotten
genetically from their parents.

When the critical period passes, the brain stops this imprinting. Critical
periods close because extreme impressibility is neither desirable nor cheap.

Critical periods happen after childhood too. Teenage years are a critical period
for peer social reward learning ("attachment to peers instead of attachment to
mom").

Critical periods can happen in adulthood too. The immediate aftermath of trauma
is a critical period with strong memory imprints.

Harmful imprinting during any critical period cannot be "unlearned", at least
not easily, because the brain is neurobiologically not open anymore to overwrite
what got imprinted. PTSD is a canonical example, but it's not the only one,
other psychiatric ailments can also be explained in terms of problematic
imprints.

So far, I've described what critical periods are, and why they're important.
From my understanding, all this is all fairly standard current scientific
consensus <RefLink href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6526538/"
title="PubMed: Adolescence as a neurobiological critical period for the development of higher-order cognition" />
.

Now lets move to the psychedelics. The claim is - psychedelics reopen critical
periods. This allows a therapist (or the person themselves introspectively) to
"overwrite" what got imprinted.

The psychedelic doesn't fix, it just biologically reopens the critical period,
allowing a window of intervention. The context determines which critical period
gets reopened.

This matches cultural memes. "Hanging up the phone when you get the message".
"Set and setting".
