People will tell you we have all sorts of biases. So what!

Our intuition is our connection to our unconscious self. Our unconscious self
deals with and processes much, much, more information than we'll ever be aware
of. For example, blindsight is the phenomenon when we are able to, say, avoid
objects that we did not even see.

Yes, it is good to be aware of our biases, but it’s not essential, and I'll
argue, even detrimental to focus too much on them. Being aware of them doesn't
even help too much. For example, being aware of the effectiveness of advertising
does not neuter its effectiveness. Similarly, you _will_ buy the $9.99 over the
$10.00 even if you're a marketeer who knows all the tricks.

We can be a bit more aware, and it helps being completely tricked, but to be
fully aware of and on the safeguard against these biases all the time would be
to deny our own full selves existence - it would entail identifying ourselves
only with our rational discursive thought. But we are much more than that.
Denying the validity of our own intuition just to safeguard against some silly
biases is like sinking a ship to drown a mouse.

If I rely on my intuition, I will be wrong. But that's how I will learn, and
that's how I'll improve my intuition.

I personally trust my intuition more than I trust my rational reasoning, for I
know: Give me any point of view, any choice, and I can justify it. What I've
found is that being accurately rational doesn't improve my conclusions, it just
increases the sophistication of the arguments I come up with to fool myself.

Reasoning, rationality, deliberate thought - these are all excellent,
indispensible, tools. But they don’t have to become my identity.

I think Kahneman's book, _Thinking Fast and Slow_, misses the forest for the
trees. I think it is in isolation a good, insightful, book but because of the
cult around it if it, and the uncritical recommendation by people that we look
up to, I consider it an harmful book because it normalises throwing away the
outcome of eons of evolution in the face of some parlour tricks.
