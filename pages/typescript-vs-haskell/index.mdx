TypeScript provides <mark>structural typing</mark>. If it walks like a duck, and
quacks like a duck, for TypeScript, it is a duck. TypeScript does not care at
all what name you give to the type.

Haskell provides <mark>nominal typing</mark>. It must be called a duck for it to
be considered a duck. A rose by any other name won’t do.

Which of these two approaches are better? I think it too early, and too
sweeping, a comparison to be valid.

TypeScript provides a gradual path to adding types to arguably the world’s most
used and least learnt language: JavaScript. JavaScript is used by people from
all sorts of backgrounds and motivations and programming experience level;
perhaps the only thing they have in common is that nobody learns JavaScript, it
is just hacked together until it works, with accompanying surprised Pikachu
faces thrown around when the poor thing doesn’t work. This is the ecosystem
TypeScript exists in.

Haskell users, as the old joke goes, all 50 of them, or 51 if I may immodestly
count myself in, on the other hand are usually experienced programmers. They
might not know the ancient scrolls of Hindley-Milner by heart, but that’s not
for lack of trying. The goal of Haskell is to provide a laboratory for
mathematics - it is the place where we can apply the abstract abstractions of
category theory to find elegant primitives for domain specific data manipulation
(aka, programming).

Both TypeScript and Haskell are based on solid, grounded, mathematics that goes
back a century at least. It is not programmers hacking these languages together
on whim and fashion (though that plays a part) - it is more of people trying to
transmute the hard nuggets of type theory into practical programming languages.

Both TypeScript and Haskell provide type inference. Which means that you won’t
_need to_ tell the compiler the type of a duck or a rose, it’ll just know.

But the surprising thing is, after a while you’ll _want to_ write the types.
Programming in these languages then becomes the game of describing the types and
how they transform into each other (as opposed to more direct approach of
describing values and how they transform into each other).

Type systems nowadays are awesome! If you’re a programmer who thinks types are a
pain, that “public static void main” ridiculousness, as I once was, I have hope
for you – not only can things be much better, they’re also so much more fun.
