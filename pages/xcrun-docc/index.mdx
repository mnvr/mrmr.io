Swift-DocC is a CLI tool to build HTML rendered documentation. It's goal is more
than just reference documentation, but also long-form subjective content:
tutorials, overviews, books - indeed, the Swift book itself is built with DocC,
and that would be the workflow closest to what I have in mind currently (I want
to use DocC to build the HTML for a standalone (to start with) Markdown file).

`docc` comes with Xcode. To run, I can just use:

```sh
xcrun docc
```

-   Swift blog - [DocC open-sourced](https://www.swift.org/blog/swift-docc/)

-   Swift blog - [DocC builds the Swift
    book](https://www.swift.org/blog/tspl-on-docc/)

Coming back to the workflow. Apple's documentation for [Writing
Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/writing-documentation)
covers all sorts of things, but it talks of a "documentation catalog". The
`docc` CLI tool also has a lot of juicy commands, however they seem to operate
on this documentation catalog, but how do we create one?

Looking at the [source for the Swift Book](https://github.com/apple/swift-book),
we can see that a documentation catalog is just (I think) a folder with a
`.docc` extension. It also seems to have an `Info.plist` file (because of course
it does, this is Apple). So maybe it is easier if we create this catalog using
Xcode itself.

In our Xcode project, use the create new file dialog <kbd>⌘ N</kbd>, press
tab <kbd>⇥</kbd> to focus the search field, type "doc", and select the
"Documentation Catalog".

It generates a new folder for us, with a single markdown file and an empty
folder. No `Info.plist`! So that's not needed for the minimal setup. Maybe we
could've just done `mkdir -p My.docc && touch My.docc/Hello.md` too.

So now that we have a documentation catalog, let us preview it:

```sh
xcrun docc preview Documentation.docc
```

Nice, it runs a preview server for us! We can open it at
_http://localhost:8080/_. Right now it displays "An unknown error has occurred",
but that's fine, that's better than those <i>Unexpected Exception</i>s at least.

Now let us add some content. I'll create a minimal markdown, replacing the
template because I think the double backticked symbol reference in the
autogenerated markdown is making docc unhappy.

With a flourish, if we reopen our preview window in the browser, we see, um, the
same error still. So that's a bit of a let down.

Coming back to the Terminal where we ran the `docc preview`, we see indeed that
DocC is displeased at us, and is

```sh
warning: An article is expected to start with a top-level heading title
```

Let's add a title then. "My Dear Pony". Hmm, still nothing.

Maybe it doesn't like my <strike>juvenile</strike> kindergarten, sense of humor.
Let me give it a better title. I'll use the name of the project. But still I see
the same error. Worse, docc has even stopped complaining about anything in the
Terminal, it is just silently ignoring us. Maybe we do need that `Info.plist`
after all?

Let's copy paste the Info.plist from the Swift Book <RefLink
href="https://github.com/apple/swift-book/blob/main/TSPL.docc/Info.plist" />
into `Documentation/Info.plist`. Still nothing.

Let's see if there's a way to get `docc` to talk to us about what's wrong.

```sh
xcrun docc help preview
```

There's `--diagnostic-level info`, but let's try the `--analyze` first:

```sh
.../Documentation.docc/Documentation.md: note: You haven't curated \
  'doc://org.swift.tspl/documentation/The-Swift-Programming-Language/Documentation'
```

Maybe it's complaining because we're using the bundle identifier of the Swift
book in the `Info.plist`. Let's remove that and try again.

Ha! `docc` crashes.

Maybe there isn't a way to build standalone articles using `docc`? Or maybe the
way is there, but it is mentioned in some of the WWDC videos I haven't watched?
Think, Manav, think.

If I go back to Xcode, and `Product > Build Documentation` action, it builds
documentation for the symbols in my actual code and shows them nicely. So it is
just misconfiguration somewhere.

From the Swift-DocC announcement post on Swift Forums <RefLink
href="https://forums.swift.org/t/announcing-swift-docc/52797" />:

> At its core, the Swift-DocC compiler accepts two kinds of inputs:

>     - An `Info.plist` file containing metadata such as the name of the

>       can be passed via the command line.

So I think I need to figure out what is the `Info.plist` file for me, instead of
just copy pasting randomly.

Let's clone the Swift book, and try to run the preview there:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/apple/swift-book.git
cd swift-book
xcrun docc preview TSPL.docc
```

Oops, this also gives the same error. The README mentions this should work:

> Run docc preview TSPL.docc in this repository's root directory.

What am I doing wrong?

I think I need to give in trying to follow the documentation for using DocC, an
irony I was trying to avoid, and instead search around on the internet.

Sure enough, I get [this result in the Swift
forums](https://forums.swift.org/t/standalone-docc-compile/52832), someone
hitting the similar roadblocks, and this encouraging reply:

> Swift-DocC does indeed support building standalone documentation catalogs
> without an associated Swift module.

And they (the same person it seems who announced Swift-DocC) give a link to [an
example](https://github.com/apple/swift-docc/tree/main/Tests/SwiftDocCTests/Test%20Bundles/BundleWithTechnologyRoot.docc)
in the swift-docc repo, under Test fixtures. Let's give it a shot:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/apple/swift-docc.git
cd "swift-docc/Tests/SwiftDocCTests/Test Bundles"
xcrun docc preview BundleWithTechnologyRoot.docc
```

Nope, still the unknown error.

Finally, let me do what I should've done what as the first step - go to
StackOverflow. And, indeed, there we find the solution <RefLink
href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76645803/unable-to-build-documentaion-using-docc-preview-file-docc"/>:

> DocC does not provide a "template" on its own. It expects it installed at a
> certain path that you don't have. You need to fetch the template and provide a
> path to it.

Let's follow the helpful instructions from the rest of the answer:

```sh
cd -
git clone https://github.com/apple/swift-docc-render-artifact
export DOCC_HTML_DIR=$(pwd)/swift-docc-render-artifact/dist

cd -
xcrun docc preview BundleWithTechnologyRoot.docc
```

It didn't work, but the error changed

> The page you're looking for can't be found.

<div style={{wordBreak: "break-all"}}>

When I look more closely, the preview URL that `docc` printed on the Terminal
now changed, and now has an additional path component. If I open
_http://localhost:8080/documentation/technologyx_ instead, it works!

</div>

Let's try this on our original file too. Let's go back to our project, delete
the `Documentation.docc` that we were tinkering with, and recreate it from
scratch.

```sh
mkdir Documentation.docc
echo World > Documentation.docc/Hello.md
xcrun docc preview Documentation.docc
```

Still doesn't work. Looks like we need something in there. After comparing with
`BundleWithTechnologyRoot.docc`, I can find that if we create this minimal
Markdown:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```md
# Hello

@Metadata {
  @TechnologyRoot
}

World
```

paste it into a file, and run (remember, we have `DOCC_HTML_DIR` defined from
above already):

```sh
pbpaste > Documentation.docc/Hello.md
xcrun docc preview Documentation.docc
```

It works indeed!

Reading around a bit more in the links I gave above, this time a bit more calmly
since I've already gotten it working, I realize it wasn't the `DOCC_HTML_DIR`
that was giving me trouble – that issue is for folks who're directly running
`docc`. I'm running it via `xcrun`, so that's not the problem. The problem was
that I was missing the `@TechnologyRoot`.

Further, it looks like this problem (requiring `@TechnologyRoot`) has already
been fixed on GitHub, just [4 days
ago](https://github.com/apple/swift-docc/pull/778)! But that's on Swift-DocC
mainline, and I'm using the docc that comes with Xcode, so the fix will take a
while to get around to me. The good part is that future people will not to go
about this whole roundabout.

So this post is mostly pointless for posterity. It just stands testament to yet
another hour that I just let be.
