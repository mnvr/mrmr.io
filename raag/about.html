      <h2>Raag FAQ</h2>

      <h3>What is a raag?</h3>

      <p>A raag in Indian music is similar to a scale in Western music.</p>

      <p>I think of raags as lying between two extremes:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>A bag of notes that go well together.</li>
        <li>A well-known melody.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The first one is known as a <em>thaat</em> in Indian music, and a
        <em>mode</em> in Western music.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        I'm simplifying a bit, as I am in the rest of the explanation.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The second one you understand - it like some well-known strand of music,
        a common motif / refrain / riff that people then start creating
        variations of.
      </p>

      <p>
        Both raags and scales lie somewhere between these two extremes, but
        raags veer more towards the second extreme. At the same time, they're
        not just fixed riffs. Instead, they are more like, say, Markov chains
        that describe how a piece of music in that raag will grow, possibly
        indefinitely.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each rendition of a raag, at the hands or the voice of a capable
        musician, is a unique instantiation of this pattern.
      </p>

      <p>
        They're still formal, except this formal structure is not written down,
        it is passed in an oral tradition from teachers to students.
      </p>

      <p>
        People try to categorize them, give them names etc so that they're
        easier to talk about. This is very useful, but it is akin to the
        relationship of grammar with language - language does not arise from the
        grammar written down in textbooks, it is the other way around, grammars
        try to capture the gist of living languages.
      </p>

      <h3>What is a thaat?</h3>

      <p>
        The raags that I'm illustrating are actually <em>thaats</em>. That is,
        there is a <em>Bhairav thaat</em> (a <em>thaat</em> being a set of 7 out
        of the 12 notes). From this same set of 7 notes can be formed many
        raags, one of which incidentally in this case is the
        <em>Bhairav raag</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ladder representation of the intervals between the notes is
        visualizing the
        <em>Bhairav thaat</em>, not the <em>Bhairav raag</em>. The raga has more
        structure and rules as compared to the thaat, but I haven't yet found a
        good way to visualize the raag itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        As another example, the illustration of <em>raag Yaman</em> is actually
        illustrating the <em>Kalyan thaat</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since these illustrations are aimed to encourage people to make music,
        not to be an authoritative source, I have traded inaccuracy (by not
        mentioning the thaats) for a more beginner friendly presentation.
      </p>

      <h3>How do I convert a raag to Western notes?</h3>

      <p>
        This is perhaps the only useful question on this page. Most instruments
        that amateurs have access to today are based on Western notes, so being
        able to convert raags to Western notes enables more people to play them.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        This is not an exact mapping. Raags are usually rendered on fretless
        instruments (the voice being one), and quarter notes feature often in
        the rendition. The mapping given here does not capture these microtones.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The Indian music tradition employs a movable set of notes. These notes
        are uttered aloud as:
      </p>

      <div class="notes">Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni</div>

      <p>
        But they don't map to a fixed frequency. Nor is there any correspondence
        to a western note like C or A.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead, what these notes describe is distances, or intervals. We can
        then pick any frequency, or any western note, as our starting note (the
        <em>Sa</em>), and then the rest of the sequence can be one-to-one mapped
        to the corresponding western notes starting from that point.
      </p>

      <p>
        Above we listed the 7 major notes. There are also 5 minor ones, for a
        total of 12. All 12 in sequence are sometimes notated as:
      </p>

      <div class="notes">S r R g G m M P d D n N</div>

      <p>
        So suppose we want to start with the note A on the guitar (say, A2, the
        open second string). We will <em>move</em> our sequence of 12 notes so
        that our starting (root) note, <em>S</em>, corresponds to A. Then, it is
        a one-to-one mapping:
      </p>

      <!-- <C.Mapping1 /> -->

      That's it.

      <h3>You didn't convert the raag?!</h3>

      <p>That was left as an exercise for the reader :)</p>

      <p>
        But let's do one example. Let's take the <em>Bhairav thaat</em>. If you
        look around on the internet, you'll find that it consists of the
        following notes:
      </p>

      <div class="notes">S r G m P d N</div>

      <p>
        Let's put these within the sequence of all 12 notes, focusing on the
        ones that form the thaat.
      </p>

      <!-- <C.BhairavNotes /> -->

      <p>
        Then let's include the mapping table from above. I've also included the
        distance from the root note.
      </p>

      <!-- <C.Mapping2 /> -->

      <p>Finally, we can read off corresponding western notes.</p>

      <div class="notes">A A<sup>#</sup> C<sup>#</sup> D E F G<sup>#</sup></div>

      <p>
        Since our mapping table used A as the root note, so these are the
        western notes corresponding to Bhairav thaat played with A as the root
        note. We can repeat the same exercise to get the raag from any other
        starting note too.
      </p>

      <h3>Have I heard the Bhairav raag already?</h3>

      <p>
        You likely have. Raag Bhairav (or more accurately, the Bhairav thaat) is
        also known as the Double Harmonic major scale, Byzantine scale, Hijaz
        Kar, or Gypsy major. A famous example of a song that uses this scale is
        <em>Misirlou</em>, the theme song for the movie Pulp Fiction.
