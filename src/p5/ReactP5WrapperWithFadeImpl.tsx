/**
 * Note: [Using client-side only code with SSR]
 *
 * Importing the Sketch component from the p5-react package in a SSR environment
 * (Gatsby) gives the "window is not defined" error (as is expected, since
 * importing p5 requires window to be available, and it isn't when server side
 * rendering).
 *
 * To resolve this, we can use loadable-components, which is primarily a code
 * splitting mechanism, but here it allow us to load components with client-side
 * dependencies asynchronously.
 *
 * For more details, see the documentation for loadable-components:
 * https://loadable-components.com/
 *
 * For a comparison with Suspense, see
 * https://github.com/mnvr/suspense-vs-loadable.
 *
 *
 * Animation
 * ---------
 *
 * We use the CSSTransition to add an appear- animation, a simple fade. However,
 * this animation must get triggered when the component is loaded, so it is
 * _this_ component that must be lazily loaded.
 *
 * Because of this extra level of indirection, we have these two separate files.
 * If you don't understand why this is the case (or you're me and have
 * forgotten), just import and use {@link ReactP5WrapperWithFade}, forget about
 * this file.
 *
 * Also, this is written as a regular function and not as an arrow React.FC
 * because apparently there isn't a simple way to make a generic React.FC.
