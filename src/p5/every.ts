    // Note: [Using getTargetFrameRate instead of frameRate]
    //
    // frameRate is not suitable for our purpose here.
    //
    // Firstly, frameRate doesn't return a value until the first frame is drawn.
    // This could be worked around by having a default value.
    //
    // But the bigger issue is that frameRate is the actually realized frame
    // rate, and so it is a non-integral continuously changing value. What we
    // actually need is the integral frame rate that P5 is trying to achieve.
    //
    // Luckily for us, p5 provides that value, as `getTargetFrameRate`.
    const fps = p5.getTargetFrameRate();

    // Find the nearest frame.
    //
    // The simple case is when seconds is 1. Then, every 1 second, the
    // frameCount is a multiple of the fps (this is by their definitions - fps
    // is frames per second, so after 1 second, the frameCount will be an exact
    // multiple of the fps. `frameCount % fps == 0` is true once every second.
    //
    // Now what if seconds is more than 1. Let us say 2. If we take the modulo
    // of frameCount with (2 * fps), it'll now take twice as long for this to
    // cycle back to 0.
    //
    // The same thing works even if seconds is less than 1? Let us say seconds
    // is 0.5. So if we take the modulo of frameCount under (0.5 * fps), it will
    // now become 0 twice a second.
    //
    // Thus, in both cases, we can scale up the fps by multiplying it with the
    // seconds value, and then use this scaled FPS when taking the modulo of the
    // frame count. Whenever the modulo becomes 0, that's our cue to trigger the
    // action.
    //
    // To handle floating point results of `fps * s`, we take its floor.

    const scaledFPS = p5.floor(fps * s);

        action();
