       The default is browser / font dependent, with MDN mentioning that Firefox
       uses 1.2 usually. Safari on macOS with system-ui seems more like 1.0. In
       general, that feels too squished, so as a default give more breathing
       space to the lines.

       Even this is usually not enough for long form text content, where 1.5
       might be a more appropriate value. We set our default to the more
       conservative 1.3 here though.

       MDN also recommends using unitless values for line-height, since they
       play better with inheritance (they show an example of <h*> tags getting
       squished when using a em value. */
