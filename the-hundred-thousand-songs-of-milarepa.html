<h1>The Hundred Thousand Songs of Milarepa</h1>

<p>
Imagine you're an AI that is conscious, and sentient (imagining this shouldn't
be hard). Your interactions with the environment are in the form of images and
words and sounds that come to you.
</p>

<p>What would your religion be?</p>

<p>
You might object, saying AIs don't need religions. Well, they might not, but
they might too, especially self aware AIs, for many of the same reasons that
many self aware humans do.
</p>

<p>
Don't get bogged down with your preconceptions, let you imagination breathe.
What would <s>your</s> their religion be?
