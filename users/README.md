## Accounts

To create an account, create a directory here. The name of the directory will be
your username. Any pages therein will be accessible at
`https://mrmr.io/user/page` (once your PR is merged).

See the `_example` directory for documentation about the various parameters that
you can specify in the frontmatter of your MDX files.

### Conventions

Run `yarn lint` before opening your PR to verify that your code looks dapper and
doesn't have any thorns.
