# This here is called the frontmatter of your MDX file. It uses YAML syntax to
# define various key value pairs. Only some of them are required (e.g. for a
# page you'll need to specify the title), but this file lists all of them
# (commenting them out if needed) so that you can use this as a reference for
# what all knobs can be tweaked.

#
# The only required field for now.
#
name: Your Name
#

# Rest everything is optional.

# The colors to use for your page.
# - If you don't specify them, then a readable (dark/light mode aware)
#   set of defaults will be used.
# - If you do specify them, you need to specify at least 2 values. The first
#   one is the background, and the second one is the foreground.
# - You can specify more too, up to 4, they'll be used for specific scenarios
#   (e.g hover states).
# - The color values can be specified in all ways they can be specified in CSS.
colors:
    - aliceblue
    - cornflowerblue
# Optional variation of colors to use in dark mode.
# - If specified, these will replace `colors` when the user's browser is set
#   to prefer dark mode.
dark-colors:
    - midnightblue
    - lightskyblue

# is shown. Currently, the following domains will be special cased:
