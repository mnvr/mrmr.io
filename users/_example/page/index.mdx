title: Example page

# Rest everything is optional

# An arbitrary date. You can set it to when you first created the page.
#
# Setting some date here is recommended though, since this is the field that
# is used to sort your pages (by default, user pages are sorted in descending
# order of this date field whenever they're being collected for listing).
#
# This field is also used to show by the `PageFooterA` component to show a date
# in the footer of pages.
#
# This is a good time to mention that you can add arbitrary fields here - even
# if the code doesn't yet know how to interpret them, they can still remain
# here to act as your reference, and could come in use later by teaching the
# code how to understand them.
#
# The date format is `YYYY-MM-DD`.
#
# If you have multiple pages with the same date, then they'll be sorted by
# their titles. However, if you wish to force them to use some particular order,
# you can use a longer date format that includes the times to disambiguate
# between them and use the order you wish (the fallback sort by title only
# happens if the date field is an exact match).

# Colors can be specified the same way they can be in the your home page.

# Links shown at the bottom of the page.
#
# These URLs are used to construct a list of links that you can then show at
# the bottom of your page, e.g. by using the `ParsedLinkButtons` component, or
# when using the `basic` layout.
#
# The algorithm to construct the final list of links uses 3 lists:
#
# 1. These links.
#
# 2. Autogenerated links. Currently the only autogenerated one is a link to
#    the GitHub source code for the page.
#
# 3. `page-links` specified in your user MDX.
#
# These are then merged, in order. If there is already an existing link to a
# known domain, then the second one will be ignored. So e.g. if you specify
# a link to GitHub here, then it'll take precedence over the autogenerated one.

#

# Set this to true if you don't want this page to show up in the site wide
# listings, e.g. `/some`.
#
# By default, this is `false`.
#
# We set it to `true` here since this is an example page.
unlisted: true
#

# Specify a layout to use.
#
# By default, the minimal CSS resets are made (primarily, setting the body
# margin to 0), and the colors are setup. Then the MDX is rendered as is.
#
# The intent is that customization should be done inside out, by abstracting
# away the customizations in `components/` and including them in the MDX.
#
# Still, should one need to, there is also the option of a more conventional
# outside in customization using a layout.
#
# See `layouts/` for supported layouts. Currently, only one exists:
# - basic
