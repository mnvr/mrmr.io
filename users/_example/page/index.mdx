# Required

title: Example page

# Rest everything is optional

# An arbitrary date. You can set it to when you first created the page.
#
# Setting some date here is recommended though, since this is the field that
# is used to sort your pages (by default, user pages are sorted in descending
# order of this date field whenever they're being collected for listing).
#
# This is a good time to mention that you can add arbitrary fields here - even
# if the code doesn't yet know how to interpret them, they can still remain
# here to act as your reference, and could come in use later by teaching the
# code how to understand them.
#
# The date format is `YYYY-MM-DD`.

# Colors can be specified the same way they can be in the user's home page.
