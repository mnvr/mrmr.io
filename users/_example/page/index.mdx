# Required

title: Example page

# Rest everything is optional

# An arbitrary date. You can set it to when you first created the page.
#
# Setting some date here is recommended though, since this is the field that
# is used to sort your pages (by default, user pages are sorted in descending
# order of this date field whenever they're being collected for listing).
#
# This is a good time to mention that you can add arbitrary fields here - even
# if the code doesn't yet know how to interpret them, they can still remain
# here to act as your reference, and could come in use later by teaching the
# code how to understand them.
#
# The date format is `YYYY-MM-DD`.
date: 2023-03-15

# Colors can be specified the same way they can be in the your home page.

#

# Links can be specified the similar to your home page. However, they'll
# behave slightly differently here.
#
# 1. All the links that are displayed in your homepage will also be displayed
#    here.
#
# 2. Any additional links that you specify here will be added to the list.
#
# 3. If you specify a link here with the same domain as is already present in
#    your home page list, it'll be overridden and the one specified here will
#    be shown.
#
# 4. The link to GitHub will be automatically generated to point to the source
#    code of the page. It'll override a link to GitHub (if any) in your home
#    page frontmatter. However, you can still override it by explicitly adding
#    a link that with a GitHub domain here.
#
# This sounds complicated, but it is all set up in a way that you can usually
# just specify the link to your socials in your home page, and then the rest
# everything will just work out of the box with reasonable defaults. Ideally
# you should be rarely needing to add links here.
